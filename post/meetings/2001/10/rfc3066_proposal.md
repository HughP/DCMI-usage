**Name:&nbsp;** RFC3066

**Label:&nbsp;** RFC 3066

**Definition:&nbsp;** Internet RFC 3066 'Tags for the Identification of Languages' specifies a primary subtag which is a two-letter code taken from ISO 639 part 1 or a three-letter code taken from ISO 639 part 2, followed optionally by a two-letter country code taken from ISO **3166.&nbsp;** When a language in ISO 639 has both a two-letter and three-letter code, use the two-letter code; when it has only a three-letter code, use the three-letter code.&nbsp;This RFC replaces RFC 1766.
