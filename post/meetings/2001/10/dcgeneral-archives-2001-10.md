Agent Issues -- Proposed Agenda, 23 October Breakout Session

This is for the Agent Issues breakout session at DC-2001 in Tokyo,  
 scheduled for Tuesday 23 October 9:30 to 11:30 (2 hours). All  
 interested parties are welcome to join the actual meeting or to  
 subscribe to the dc-agents discussion list (instructions are at  
 the end of this message).

\* Introduction and current status (15 mins)

\* Changes to agenda? (5 mins)

\* Definitions and architectural context (10 mins)

Assumptions to clarify during discussion:

+ what namespace model -- (eg, dcq:, AC:)  
 + syntax model(s) -- XML, XML/RDF, HTML, other?  
 + metadata ambitions: rich & expressive vs cheap & simple  
 + "application profile" vs new element set?  
 + relationship to DCMI element set, which is  
 Title Contributor Source  
 Creator Date Language  
 Subject Type Relation  
 Description Format Coverage  
 Publisher Identifier Rights

\* Charter review and possible emendation (60 mins)

1. Develop a commentary which sets out the rationale and purpose of  
 an agent record and an agent element set.

2. Develop a Recommendation for an agent element set, possibly to  
 include agent element qualifiers.

3. Propose qualifiers for the Creator, Contributor, and Publisher  
 (the CCP) elements of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.  
 This activity is completely independent of the agent element set.

4. Provide input to the DCMI Architecture working group concerning  
 a recommended mechanism for linking CCP elements to agent records.

\* Create Milestones: Task Assignments and Due Dates (30 mins)
