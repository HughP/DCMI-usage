Proposed Section 3.3. Criteria for Evaluation of Proposals

3.3.1. Clarity

3.3.1.1. Can the term be clearly defined?

3.3.1.2. Can the semantics of the proposed element or element qualifier be expressed precisely, unambiguously, and briefly?

3.3.2. Practicality

3.3.2.1. Is the term practical?

3.3.2.2. How difficult would it be for people creating metadata to comprehend the semantics of the proposed element or element qualifier and to apply it reasonably in the description of resources?

3.3.3. Placement

3.3.3.1. Does the term refine an existing element?

3.3.3.2. If the proposed term is an element, can it reasonably be handled as effectively as an element or value qualifier for an existing element?

3.3.3.3. Are there alternative ways of implementing the term? Within the conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set (i.e., element/element qualifiers and value/value qualifiers), are there alternative ways to achieve the ends sought?

3.3.4. Needs

3.3.4.1. Is there a clear requirement in existing implementations for the term in support of resource discovery?

3.3.4.2. Is there a demonstrated need for the proposed element, element qualifier, or value qualifier?

3.3.4.3. Are there existing implementations or controlled vocabularies, etc., supporting the term?
