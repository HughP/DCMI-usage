How can I use existing controlled vocabularies for DC Subject metadata?

One can assign a metadata value selected from a controlled vocabulary as the
value of the element, and then qualify that element with the name or
identifier of the scheme from which it is selected (the specifics of the
encoding depends on the syntax being employed. Refer to DCMI specifications
for details of encoding DC metadta in HTML, XML, or RDF/XML.

DCMI registers controlled vocabularies and encoding schemes to promote their
use and to facilitate consistent identification within DC metadata.
Application designers should review registered controlled vocabularies to
determine if there is a suitable one for their application, and use the
registered name of that vocabulary in their application. For example, "DDC"
is the registered Name for the Dewey Decimal Classification, and should be
used as the value of the qualifier. By using registered Names or tokens to
designate schemes, metadata from different applications that use common
controlled vocabularies are more likely to be interoperable.

The mechanics of selecting a value from such a vocabulary is dependent on
the application. It is expected that metadata editors for some domains will
have tools to support such selection, but it can also be done with
conventional print-based references.

Can I use controlled vocabularies that are not approved by DCMI?

Yes. DCMI registers only those controlled vocabularies that have been
brought to our attention. There are, of course, many others that are
equally legitimate, and it has always been our intent that communities of
expertise be able to leverage the value of such existing schemes in their
metadata. To promote interoperability, it is recommended that application
designers review registered controlled vocabularies for one that may be
suitable for their application. If a controlled vocabulary of choice is not
registered with DCMI, it is possible (but not mandatory) to register it.
Registration assures that others who adopt this vocabulary use the same Name
token in their metadta, thereby promoting interoperability.

It is important to note that DCMI 'registers' controlled vocabularies,
rather than 'approving' them. Controlled vocabularies are generally the
result of substantial community expertise. It is not in the purview of DCMI
to approve or disapprove such works, but rather help to make them visible
for others who might choose to adopt them, and to prevent Name collisions by
assigning unique tokens to identify them within DC metadata.

How can I register a controlled vocabulary with DCMI?

There are guidelines and instructions for registering controlled
vocabularies at http://dublincore.org/xxxxxxx. It is expected that
registration of controlled vocabularies be done by the maintenance agency
associated with the vocabulary, but others may facilitate such registrations
by contacting DCMI, the maintenance agency, or both.
