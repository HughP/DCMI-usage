Notes from May 2005

1) We need to look carefully at the RDF schema binding to 
   determine which of the attributes used in [1] and [2] are
   really needed in the RDF schemas.  From my notes, here is 
   a draft mapping, with reference to a hypothetical namespace
   "dcu:" to hold terms not yet formally declared:

   Name:              NOT USED
   Namespace:         rdfs:isDefinedBy   rdf:resource="xxx"
   Label:             rdfs:label         xml:lang="en-US"
   Definition:        rdfs:comment       xml:lang="en-US"
   Type of term:      rdf:type           rdf:resource="http://.../#element"
   Status:            dcu:status         rdf:resource="http://.../#recommended"
   Date issued:       dcterms:issued
   Comment:           dc:description     xml:lang="en-US"
   See:               rdfs:seeAlso       rdf:resource="http://..."
   References:        dcterms:references rdf:resource="http://.../#W3CDTF"
   Refines:           rdfs:subPropertyOf
   Qualifies:         dcu:qualifies
   Date modified:     dcq:Modified
   Decision:          dcu:decision       rdf:resource = "uri"
   Version:           dcu:version        rdf:resource = "uri"
   Replaces:          NOT USED
   Is Replaced By:    NOT USED
   Broader Than:      NOT USED
   Narrower Than:     rdfs:subClassOf

   Of course, we need to consider the possibility that not
   all of the attributes of [1] and [2] would be needed in
   the RDF schemas.

2) If we accept the mappings of some terms defined in [1] and [2]
   to existing terms in namespaces maintained by W3C and to DCMI's
   own Terms namespace, then at a minimum it would appear we would
   need to declare the following:

       dcu:status      - Harry needs this for the DCMI Registry
       dcu:qualifies
       dcu:decision       
       dcu:version        

3) In addition, it would appear we need the term

       dcu:isTranslationOf

   Harry needs this for the DCMI Registry, and Tom thinks this
   is needed so that a translation of DCMI term definitions
   into languages such as Japanese can reference the specific
   Term Version used as the basis for the translation.

4) The term dcu:status has, in effect, a controlled vocabulary 
   of values:

       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#conforming
       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#recommended
       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#registered

   These are currently defined in the document DCMI Usage Board
   Process, and the URIs are anchors to specific points in that
   document.  We should consider whether it is a good idea to
   continue this or whether we would want to declare a status
   vocabulary, and if so, how their URIs should be formed.

5) The term "Type of Term" (currently mapped in the RDF
   binding to rdf:type) also has, in effect, a controlled vocabulary
   of values:

       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#element-refinement
       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#element
       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#encoding-scheme
       http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#vocabulary-term

6) Work on the DCMI Abstract Model [3] and a formal model for
   DCMI Application Profiles [4] suggests a need for several
   other terms, along the lines of:

       dcu:ApplicationProfile
       dcu:PropertyUsage

   In September 2004, Pete posted a strawman set of terms at
   http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~lispj/cen-cwa/vocab/dcapterms.rdf.

7) DCMI's RDF schemas [5] have long asserted the existence of
   URI references for terms based on the DCMI Namespace
   http://purl.org/dc/terms/ -- even though, technically,
   this should not have been possible without going through
   UB process.  These include:

       http://purl.org/dc/terms/DateScheme
       http://purl.org/dc/terms/FormatScheme
       http://purl.org/dc/terms/IdentifierScheme
       http://purl.org/dc/terms/LanguageScheme
       http://purl.org/dc/terms/SpatialScheme
       http://purl.org/dc/terms/SubjectScheme
       http://purl.org/dc/terms/TypeScheme

   We would need to formulate a policy for creating,
   maintaining, and identifying such terms - bearing
   in mind that the terms above are already "legacy"
   (i.e., for all we know, there may be applications
   in the world that would break if DCMI were to 
   drop or deprecate these terms).

8) Since the addition of 

        http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/MovingImage
        http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage

   we have two new attributes for Vocabulary Terms:

        Broader Than
        Narrower Than - currently represented with rdfs:subClassOf
