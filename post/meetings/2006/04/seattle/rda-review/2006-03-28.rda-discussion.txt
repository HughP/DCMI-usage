Thanks for sharing this, I think it expresses some of my concerns as 
well (though you're clearly more adept with a metaphor than I am!).

I'm also concerned that, if we defer dealing with these issues now 
(largely in our desire to meet a publication deadline) we may never 
have the opportunity to provide the leadership you discuss below. If 
the RDA proceeds along the current path, others will fill the void we 
refuse to address, and the RDA will indeed be AACR3 in everything but 
name.

I spent part of this weekend re-reading two reports: one is the 
recent one from California ("Rethinking How We Provide Bibliographic 
Services for the University of California," available at: 
http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/sopag/BSTF/Final.pdf) and 
the other one (not yet publicly released) by Karen Calhoun for the 
Library of Congress. These two reports should be required reading for 
all those participating in RDA development--they are the leading edge 
of calls to drastically simplify what we do in library cataloging, 
and look towards other models of bibliographic service provision for 
cues to our future.

I take issue with a few of the specific recommendations, but support 
the general thrust away from our wagon-centric legacy. We have an 
enormous amount of experience and knowledge to offer the rest of the 
world, as they struggle with the challenges of metadata creation, 
maintenance and distribution, but we will be pushed to the side of 
the road if we can't broaden our view--now, not for RDA2.

Regards,
Diane
