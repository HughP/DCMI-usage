The DCMI Libraries Working Group has a Working Group for
Reviewing Resource Description and Access (RDA) [1]. There has
been discussion on various DCMI lists raising fundamental
issues about "cataloging" in the Web environment [2,3].
Diane has included here a draft essay about the issues [5].

In particular, there have been some important comments on RDA
part 1 from the the Program for Cooperative Cataloging of The
Library of Congress, Standing Committee on Standards (SCS) [4],
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pcc/standards.html">http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pcc/standards.html</a>.

As a Usage Board we should be aware of these discussions
and consider taking a stand or otherwise contribute to this
discussion. Please review the readings included in the packet
for discussion in Seattle.
