In March, Diane made some initial edits on the Wikipedia
article about Dublin Core [1], opening a discussion on
dc-usage. Andy posted a strawman description putting DCAM at
the center. For Seattle, everyone please read the Wikipedia
article and dc-usage digest [2] for a discussion of how
"the DCMI story" should be told.
