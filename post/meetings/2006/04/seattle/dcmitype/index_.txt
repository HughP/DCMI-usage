A public comment period was held from 8 Dec to 31 Jan on
changes to the DCMI Type Vocabulary [1].  The responses have
been summarized in tabular form [2].

The finalization of the DCMI Type Vocabulary changes depends on
resolution of the "stylistic" issue in the topic "DCMI property
domains and ranges" [3].
