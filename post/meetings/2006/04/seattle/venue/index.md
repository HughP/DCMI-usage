All, please accept my apologies for being so late getting logistical
information to you for the Seattle meeting Saturday and Sunday, April
29-30 (Board meeting on Monday, May 1). Both the Usage Board and Board
of Trustees meetings will be held in Mary Gates Hall (MGH) room
310D--one the iSchool's conference rooms on the University of Washington
(UW) campus. Here is a link to the campus map with MGH circled:

network access without authentication and wireless with authentication
(working on having wireless for you without authentication).

HOTELS:

There are three comparable hotels within easy walking distance (5
minutes) of the UW campus. We will need you to make your own room
reservations. I have listed the three below in descending order of
expense (althought Watertown and University Tower are priced fairly
similarly). The University Inn is reasonably priced and quite
satisfactory. Until recently, the Inn was the primary hotel in the area
for University guests. The Watertown is the newest and considered one
of the best hotels in Seattle. The University Tower was recently
renovated. All three have Internet access. All three are approximately
10 minutes from downtown by cab (Watertown has free dowtown shuttle).
