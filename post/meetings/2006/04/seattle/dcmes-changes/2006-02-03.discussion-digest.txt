Subject: FW: Encoding scheme used for dc.language - heads up
To: DC-USAGE@JISCMAIL.AC.UK

For those who haven't spotted it, there is a little flurry of discussion
on the dc-government list suggesting that RFC 3066 is perhaps now a
little dated in its approach to 2 vs. 3-letter language codes.

The comment for dc:language currently suggests that value strings should
conform to that RFC whereas it is possible that concensus within
eGovernment metadata circles is to use 3-letter codes (as also suggested
by Joseph Busch in his response to the dc-corporate WG).

Martin,
Thanks for the summary.  I very much agree.  Speaking as a member of the
Usage Board, I think that if this working group can reach a concensus
view that the current DC guidance to use RFC 3066 is wrong and, better
still, suggest some revised wording for the dc:language comment, then
I'm sure that a good case could be made to the UB for change.  (Note,
I'm not necessarily promising that change would be forthcoming! :-) ).

Note that the UB is in the process of considering some minor changes to
the comment for dc:language anyway, because the current wording gives
both 'en' and 'eng' as valid examples for English, the second of which
falls foul of the "2-letter rule" in the RFC.

Note also that in "qualified DC" it is already perfectly acceptable to
use the dcterms:ISO639-2 encoding scheme to explicitly indicate that
3-letter codes are in use.  E.g. (in XHTML meta tags):

<meta name=3D"DC.language" scheme=3D"DCTERMS.ISO639-2" content=3D"fre" =
/>

I presume that when using this encoding scheme, alternative forms of
3-letter codes are allowed (where they exist), e.g.

<meta name=3D"DC.language" scheme=3D"DCTERMS.ISO639-2" content=3D"fra" =
/>

is also valid?
