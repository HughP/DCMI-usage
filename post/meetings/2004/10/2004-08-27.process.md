## Part 1-Usage Board: Overview, Meetings, Documentation

### 1. <a id="one." name="one.">Usage Board Membership <font color="#ff0000">and Participation</font></a>
> **1.1.** The UB will consist of at least seven and no more than eleven people (nine is ideal) appointed by the DCMI Directorate.  
> **1.2.** Usage Board member terms shall be for two year <font color="#ff0000">terms which are renewable</font>. Initial appointments will be made so as to stagger terms.  
> **1.3.** Members should be selected based on the following criteria:
> 
> > **1.3.1.** Knowledgeable concerning the development history and purpose of the DC element set and its relationship to the metadata world at large;  
> > **1.3.2.** Related to a metadata community relevant to DCMI;  
> > **1.3.3.** Willing and able to commit time and energy to the functions of the UB;  
> > **1.3.4.** Able to communicate verbally and in writing in English well enough to prepare documents and discuss complex issues in a group setting;  
> > **1.3.5.** Geographic and domain distribution of members is relevant but will not override other criteria.
> 
> **1.4.** The UB Chair will be appointed from one of the membership by the DCMI Directorate. The term of the chair shall be for a two year<font color="#ff0000"> term which is renewable</font>.  
> **<font color="red">1.5.</font>** Liaisons from DCMI affiliates may be appointed by DCMI management in consultation with the Usage Board Chair.
> 
> > **1.5.1.** Liaisons are non-voting but are encouraged to participate in discussion on the Usage Board list and at meetings.  
> > **1.5.2.** Liaisons do not serve as shepherds. **1.6.** For internal communication the UB uses the closed mailing list dc-usage@jiscmail.ac.uk. The messages are archived and publicly available at [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html).
### 2. <a id="two." name="two.">Meetings</a>
> **2.1.** Scheduling
> 
> > **2.1.1.** Meetings should be held at least twice a year.
> > 
> > > **2.1.1.1.** One meeting should be scheduled during the annual DC general workshop/conference.  
> > > **2.1.1.2.** The second should be scheduled at a different time of the year, preferably close to other conferences, so as to make attendance convenient for as many members as possible.  
> > > **2.1.1.3.** Scheduling should be done far enough in advance so that as many members as possible may be present.
> 
> **2.2.** Funding for <font color="red">regular UB member attendance at </font> meetings should be supported as much as possible by DCMI.
> 
> > <font color="red"><strong>2.2.1.</strong> Funding for Liaisons attendance at UB meetings should be supported by their institution.</font> **2.3.** Meeting agenda> **2.3.1.** The UB Chair maintains the agenda, which cites links to relevant supporting documentation, including JISCMAIL postings.  
> > **2.3.2.** All materials pointed to in the agenda are archived at http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/ after the final pre-meeting version of the agenda has been distributed. After the meeting, the archive version of the agenda is edited to point to these archive copies.
> 
> **2.4.** Attendance by members
> 
> > **2.4.1.** Members must attend at least one meeting in a given year to maintain membership in good standing.  
> > **2.4.2.** Members who miss two meetings in succession may be replaced by the DC Directorate.
> 
> **2.5.** Attendance by others
> 
> > **2.5.1.** Attendance at UB meetings by other than the UB is by invitation.
> > 
> > > **2.5.1.1.** People interested in attending should request an invitation via the UB Chair or the Managing Director.
> > 
> > **2.5.2.** Participation in discussion of proposals by any interested parties is encouraged.
> 
> **2.6.** Agenda preparation and distribution
> 
> > **2.6.1.** The UB chair is responsible for preparing the meeting agendas and assigning shepherds to proposals.  
> > **2.6.2.** Agenda items shall include the name and email address of the UB member responsible for shepherding the proposal through the UB process.  
> > **2.6.3.** Agendas shall be available at http://www.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/ a few weeks before the meeting.
> 
> **2.7.** Important decisions will be assigned a number for citation purposes and documented on the DCMI website.
### 3. <a id="three." name="three.">Categories of Usage Board Decisions</a>
<a id="recommended" name="recommended"></a>> **3.1.**  **_Recommended_:** Elements, Element Refinements, and DCMI-maintained Vocabulary Terms (e.g., member terms of the DCMI Type Vocabulary) useful for resource discovery across domains.  
> <a id="conforming" name="conforming"></a> **3.2.**  **_Conforming_:** Elements, Element Refinements and Application Profiles may be assigned a status of conforming. Elements and Element Refinements assigned a status of conforming are those for which an implementation community has a demonstrated need and which conform to the grammar of Elements and Element Refinements, though without necessarily meeting the stricter criteria of usefulness across domains or usefulness for resource discovery.  
> <a id="obsolete" name="obsolete"></a> **3.3.**  **_Obsolete_:** For Elements and Element Refinements that have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete. Such terms will remain in the registry for use in interpreting legacy metadata.  
> <a id="registered" name="registered"></a> **3.4.**  **_Registered_:** Used for Vocabulary Encoding Schemes and language translations for which the DCMI provides information but not necessarily a specific recommendation.

### 5. <a id="five." name="five.">Proposals for Registration of Encoding Schemes</a> <font color="#ff0000">[SECTION 5 UNDER REVISION BY DIANE]</font>
 <font color="green">[NOTE: Some items deleted; Communication Table deleted.]</font>> **5.1.** Submissions of new encoding schemes <font color="red">may be forwarded to the UB Chair no later than six weeks prior to the next scheduled UB meeting.</font>  
> **5.2.** <font color="red">A shepherd will be assigned to evaluate the</font> submissions. <font color="red">Shepherd assignment will be</font> based on:
> 
> > **5.2.1.** Knowledge of a particular scheme  
> > **5.2.2.** Knowledge of the language used in the scheme  
> > **5.2.3.** Interest or knowledge of a particular subject or topical area covered by the scheme  
> > **5.2.4.** Time <font color="red"> the member has</font> available for such tasks
> 
> **5.3** The UB chair will not shepherd individual submissions, but will keep track of submissions and ensure that all are resolved in some manner.  
> **5.4.** The shepherd will be responsible for verifying the submitted information:
> 
> > **5.4.1.** Name of the scheme  
> > **5.4.2.** Availability and maintenance status  
> > **5.4.3.** Appropriateness of the maintenance agency  
> > **5.4.4.** Uniqueness and appropriateness of the proposed token  
> > **5.4.5.** Possible use with elements not specified in the proposal
> 
> **5.5.** If necessary, the shepherd will initiate contact with the maintenance agency in the case of questions or concerns about the status of the scheme, the proposed token, or to clarify the submission.  
> **5.6.** The shepherd will edit the submission and complete the registration process by submitting the information to the DCMI Web Team.<font color="green">[NOTE: Whether or not this is sufficient depends on whether we are still planning to maintain a simple web page of vocabularies.]</font>  
> **5.7.** The DCMI Web Team will report to the UB list when registration has been completed.  
> **5.8.** The UB chair will <font color="red">announce</font> new schemes <font color="red">as needed</font>.  
> **5.9.** Communication Responsibility Table
### 6. <a id="six." name="six.">Proposals for Registration of Application Profiles</a>
> **6.1.** Sources of proposals
> 
> > **6.1.1.** DCMI working groups <font color="#ff0000">or working groups established for the purpose of developing one or more proposals
> > </font>  
> > **6.1.1.1.** Existing working groups  
> > **6.1.1.2.** Working groups established for the purpose of developing proposals
> 
> **6.1.2.** Metadata implementers<font color="#ff0000">, established projects or research groups</font>   
> **6.1.3.** UB itself
> 
> **6.2.** For the purposes of review by the Usage Board:
> 
> > **6.2.1.** The Usage Board is interested in reviewing application profiles that make substantial use of Dublin Core elements. The review of application profiles by the Usage Board serves to:
> > 
> > > **6.2.1.1.** analyze the usage of Dublin Core within significant implementations;  
> > > **6.2.1.2.** assign a DCMI stamp of approval;  
> > > **6.2.1.3.** promote the sharing of application profiles between communities; and  
> > > **6.2.1.4.** identify new terms as candidates for inclusion in DCMI namespaces.
> > 
> > **6.2.2.** Application profiles must provide, for each term, an identifier of the element set where it is defined, ideally in the form of URIs for individual terms.  
> > **6.2.3.** If the terms in an application profile describe anything other than generic "resources" (the typical domain of Dublin Core), the application profile must make this clear. This is particularly important if an application profile is based on a data model that describes multiple classes of resources, such as agents or collections.  
> > **6.2.4.** It is recommended that application profiles be prepared using previously reviewed application profiles <font color="#ff0000">be prepared using the Dublin Core Application Profile guidelines published by CEN (ftp://ftp.cenorm.be/public/ws-mmi-dc/mmidc076.zip).</font>  
> > **6.2.5.** Each application profile must provide, or point to, a short text that describes:
> > 
> > > **6.2.5.1.** The context and purposes in which the application profile is used or is likely to be used.  
> > > **6.2.5.2.** The organizations or individuals involved in its development and a capsule history thereof.  
> > > **6.2.5.3.** Any arrangements, policies, or intentions regarding the future development and maintenance of the application profile.
> 
> **6.3.** Review of Application Profiles by the Usage Board
> 
> > **6.3.1.** An application profile is "well-formed" if it is presented in accordance with the broad and flexible requirements outlined above. These presentation requirements may become more specific as "good practice" emerges over time.  
> > **6.3.2.** Usage Board review focuses on the use of terms related to Dublin Core terms and on any data models that provide a context for those terms. The Usage Board is agnostic about the use of terms not directly related to Dublin Core; strictly speaking such terms are outside the scope of Usage Board review.  
> > **6.3.3.** The use of terms related to Dublin Core (such as refinements of Dublin Core elements, or Dublin Core elements that have been constrained for particular contexts) will be evaluated from the standpoint of semantic conformance, grammatical principle (eg, "dumb-down"), clarity, and good practice.
> 
> **6.4.** Publication and use of Usage Board Reviews
> 
> > **6.4.1.** An application profiles that "pass" review will be assigned the status of 'conforming' <font color="#ff0000">and a date stamp. Changes to the application profile will be considered a new application profile and will require a new submission to the UB and a new timestamp.</font>  
> > **6.4.2.** For application profiles that "pass" review, the Usage Board will publish a Review on a Web page for application profiles.  
> > **6.4.3.** Each Review will include, at a minimum:
> > 
> > > **6.4.3.1.** Any comments from the Usage Board on the application profile.  
> > > **6.4.3.2.** Pointers to locally archived copies of the application profile as originally submitted and (if necessary) as subsequently amended in light of Usage Board comments.  
> > > **6.4.3.3.** A pointer to the "latest version" of an application profile held by its maintainers.
> 
> **6.5.** Review represents a form of recognition, and its URL will be persistent for purposes of citation.
