MARC Relator Terms

* Approved set of circa 100 MARC Relator terms as
    sub-properties of dc:contributor. Model: Library of 
    Congress asserts the sub-property relationship and
    Usage Board endorses those assertions.

* DCMI needs an RDF-based mechanism for recording UB's
    endorsement of each LoC assertion.

Element proposal: Accessibility

* Approved "Accessibility" as Recommended element.

* Definition: A description of the
    qualities of the resource in terms of control, display
    and content that can be used to match the needs and
    preferences of a user.

Term proposals: Collection Description

* Approved the following as "conforming" elements:

    accrualMethod
    accrualPeriodicity
    accrualPolicy

* Unable to approve or reject proposals for 3 DC-CD
    controlled vocabularies. Defer decision, pending
    clarification about the ongoing maintenance of such
    vocabularies by DCMI.

Term proposal: Instructional Method

* Approved conforming element Instructional Method:
    'A process, used to engender knowledge, attitudes and
    skills, that the resource is designed to support'.

Issues related to the element Date

* Will encourage the Date Working Group to suggest a change
    to the definition or comment for the Date element to clarify
    that a range of dates is valid as a value.

* Determined that the need for one or more encoding schemes
    for ISO 8601-conformant dates needed further study by
    the Date Working Group.

Encoding Schemes

* Need to develop a policy, process, mechanism and
    documentation for endorsing non-DCMI encoding scheme URIs
    coined by external organisations or people to identify
    their own vocabularies.

* Will discuss these new options with NLM.

* For each of the currently recommended encoding schemes
    we need to determine if it is a syntax encoding scheme or
    a vocabulary encoding scheme.

Abstract Model

* Agreed to review the wording of element definitions for
    consistency with the abstract model.

Document "Element Refinement in Dublin Core Metadata"

* Recommends to the Directorate that DCMI publish as a
    'recommended resource'.

Versioning of term descriptions

* Agreed to continue the current practice of treating
    the description of a DCMI term as a discrete "bundle of
    attributes" that is assigned a new URI each time anything
    in that "bundle" is updated.
