Shepherd: Andy

DCMI has a specification for Dublin Core Structured Values
(DCSV), "syntax for writing a list of labelled values in a
text string":

    <a href="/documents/dcmi-dcsv/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-dcsv/</a>

and three recommendations for specific types of DCSVs:

    <a href="/documents/dcmi-box/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-box/</a>
    <a href="/documents/dcmi-period/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-period/</a>
    <a href="/documents/dcmi-point/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-point/</a>

The Usage Board has a long-standing action on Andy and Andrew
to revise the DCSV Specification and the various DCSV scheme
specifications after approval of the Abstract Model as a
DCMI Recommendation. The Abstract Model is still a "working
draft", so this action remains in limbo.

More recently, Pete has posted to DC-ARCHITECTURE regarding
the fact that the component parts of a structured value
are not directly accessible to an RDF application because
the literal requires additional parsing by a DCSV or
XML parser. He asks whether there is "any plan to assign
URIrefs to the 'components' described in these structured
value recommendations - or indeed, find existing non-DCMI
vocabularies already in use and describe how they can be
applied to these cases - so that they can be used as RDF
properties and the information is explicitly available in
the RDF graph?" [1].
