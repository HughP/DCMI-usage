Metadata based on standards such as Dublin Core is a key
component of information environments from scientific
repositories to corporate intranets and from business and
publishing to education and e-government.
 
DC-2004 -- the fourth in a series of conferences previously
held in Tokyo, Florence, and Seattle -- will examine a broad
range of metadata applications, especially with a view towards
improving interoperability across boundaries of language,
culture, and communities of practice.  Tutorials will provide
an introduction to metadata for non-experts.
 
In conjunction with DC-2004, the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative will hold technical working-group meetings and
Shanghai Library will host the 2004 Shanghai International
Library Forum (http://www.libnet.sh.cn/silf2004/).
 
The Conference track of DC-2004 invites submissions of papers
in the following areas:
 
-- Conceptual models for metadata
-- Interoperability among metadata systems and standards
-- Enterprise metadata
-- Globalization, localization, and multilinguality of metadata
-- Metadata for education, e-Government, and geospatial applications
-- Institutional Repositories and metadata harvesting
-- Search engines and metadata
-- Systems and tools for metadata applications
-- Metadata for cultural heritage and long-term preservation
-- Surveys, case studies, and novel activities based on metadata
-- Metadata registries and registry services
-- Metadata standardization
-- Ontologies and Semantic Web
-- Knowledge management
