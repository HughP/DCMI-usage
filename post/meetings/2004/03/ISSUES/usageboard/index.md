SUMMARY

1. Voting in the Usage Board

   The DCMI Directorate has been working with the Board of
   Trustees on a set of by-laws for DCMI. One aspect of
   the draft -- on the request of the trustees -- will be to
   formulate a coherent approach to voting that cross-cuts
   different types of committees, including the Usage Board.
   Tom will circulate copies of the section of the bylaws
   dealing with the Usage Board for discussion and feedback.

2. Recruitment

   Tom will circulate an excerpt from the draft bylaws in
   which "liaisons" are defined (based on the proposal by
   Diane and Rebecca).

3. Next meeting in Shanghai
