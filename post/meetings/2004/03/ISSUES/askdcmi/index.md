Background

After the AskDCMI service [1] had been operational for a year
or so, a number of related issues were discussed in Ithaca
in June 2003 [2,3].

In February 2004, Tom raised a number of questions regarding 
the maintenance of AskDCMI content and of the Usage Board
role in its regard [4]. In particular, he suggested that there
could be a stronger relationship between the AskDCMI service
and DCMI's FAQ [5].
