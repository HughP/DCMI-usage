ITHACA/SEATTLE ACTION (Directorate)
    Talk with ISO and NISO re posting copies of standards on 
    DCMI website.
    We need to check with NISO and ISO what the rules are that they
    have for 'Maintenance Agencies'
    -- do we get the right to post the final text of these standards 
       on our Web site?
    -- how can we make changes and feed them back into the standard
       (e.g. can we fast-track the capitalization issue)?

ITHACA ACTION (Stuart)
    The UB process document be amended to clarify that change
    requests from Working Groups should not combine a number
    of unrelated proposals.

to using a label within relation if a refinement is not
being used.
