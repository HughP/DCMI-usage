TOPIC 09. Libraries profile (Rebecca)

   A brief report should identify any further actions that
   may need to be undertaken by Usage Board in support of
   the Library Application Profile. We should try to approve
   the nine proposed encoding schemes on a fast-track basis.
   With reference to the Usage Board review guidelines, we
   should discuss the feasibility of undertaking a formal
   review of the profile at the Seattle meeting.

   The entire Libraries Application Profile is included in
   the "background readings" packet.
