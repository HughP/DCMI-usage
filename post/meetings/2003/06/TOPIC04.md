TOPIC 04. "Using Dublin Core" (Diane)

    Diane has revised "Using Dublin Core" (e.g., with specific
    guidance for individual element refinements). Since DCMI
    has no real process for approving the revision of this
    document (or at least none that really works), we should
    figure out how to bring the process of revision to a close.
    Time permitting, we could perhaps return to this document
    after other business is taken care of in order to discuss
    issues of content.

    Time needed: 30"

== There are five main documents, linked to this URL:
   <a href="http://content.nsdl.org/dcub/">http://content.nsdl.org/dcub/</a> (TOM: these have been archived
   on <a href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org/</a>)

    The links DO NOT work properly, some of that work needs to
    wait until they're back on the DCMI site, so our focus at
    this stage is on content.

    Here's a list of the major changes in this version:

    1. I've updated the table of elements, refinements, schemes
    (very popular in the old documentation) to reflect all the
    current terms. Yes, I know the schemes will change soon,
    and I'd appreciate some suggestions on how to handle that.

    2. Added guidance for all new elements and element refinements
    (only specific guidance and examples in the old documentation
    was for the original 15).

    Question: How should links work? Currently the links from
    the table to the basic term reference statements in Tom's
    document, not to the usage guidance (I think it should be the
    other way round). Reference information in the guidance is
    not the complete form (no status, for example): should all
    that be included, just a part, or should each guide section
    have a link back to the basic list and be kept minimal?

    3. Audience has been a real pain, as it's the only element
    level thing in the "qualifiers" document. I'm still convinced
    it ought to be in this section but am not sure I've done it
    that well, and it's one of the most persistent questions we
    get asked. Should it also be in the list of elements (now
    categorized as: Content, Intellectual Property, Instantiation),
    and if so, where should it go? Do those three categories
    still work?

    4. Examples:

    The old documentation attempted to include examples in each
    syntax. I'd like to nix that and just go back to generic
    examples in the document (It's impossible to do it properly
    the other way, I've found). If generic examples are the right
    thing, should there be some for each new term? If the answer is
    "yes" to that, I'd really like some help coming up with a few!

    In general it would help if y'all could read through what I've
    said about how to apply the element refinements (as well as
    audience), and make suggestions for improvement.

== Diane wants to keep the discussion at a fairly high
   level and address the following questions:

   1. Does the approach to the additional refinements
      seem sound (specific comments can be sent to me or
      the Userguides list). In particular, I'm looking for
      feedback on how I coped with Audience.

   2. Is the organization appropriate? Do the three
      categorizations for the basic elements still work? Should
      we continue that with the refinements?

   3. How should this update be versioned (if at all?). What
      else should be done to "vet" it prior to replacing the
      old version? What timetable is appropriate (should we aim
      to get the new version out prior to DC2003, or sooner?)

== The table of elements, refinements, and schemes was
   very popular in the old documentation, and Diane
   needed to update it to reflect all of the current terms.
   Tom noted that this keeps coming up as a popular request.
   Perhaps someone could write a script that generates a
   nice Web table either from the raw Usage Board data at
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/xml">http://dublincore.org/usage/xml</a>, or from the RDF schemas
   (which are themselves generated from the raw data), such as
   the currently valid <a href="http://dublincore.org/2003/03/24/dcq">http://dublincore.org/2003/03/24/dcq</a>.
   Or could such a table perhaps already be generated by the
   DCMI Registry and then posted as a Web page? If the table
   is indeed useful -- and it would appear to be so -- then the
   burden should not lie on the maintainer of "Using Dublin
   Core" to generate an update; one should be able simply to
   point to the generic address of a table maintained by DCMI.
