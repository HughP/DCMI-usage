TOPIC 14. Seattle meeting and timing (Tom)

    DC2003 is scheduled for Sunday 28 September through
    Thursday 2 October 2003. In scheduling a Usage Board
    meeting we need to consider that Rosh-Hashanah is on
    September 27-28 and Yom Kippur on Monday, 7 October.
    These constraints seem to point towards holding a UB
    meeting after the conference, so we will need to discuss
    the exact timing.
