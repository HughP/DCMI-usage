Title: Differences between Usage Board declarations and NISO/ISO
Date: 2003-06-11

This is a summary of differences
between the hitherto authortative data at
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/10/06/current-elements">http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/10/06/current-elements</a>
("UB-data") and the DCMES 1.1 document
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/</a> as brought
into synch by Makx with NISO Z39.85 ("ISO-doc"). (also
<a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-85.pdf">http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-85.pdf</a> and
<a href="http://www.niso.org/international/SC4/n515.pdf">http://www.niso.org/international/SC4/n515.pdf</a>.)

Makx found differences in the Comments for Language and Type
between <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/1999/07/02/dces/">http://dublincore.org/documents/1999/07/02/dces/</a>
and <a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-85.pdf">http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-85.pdf</a>,
but these differences were already corrected for
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/10/06/current-elements">http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/10/06/current-elements</a>.

The one biggest and most obvious difference is in the case of
the "names" of the fifteen elements.
