Title: Information on the venue from Diane
Date: 2003-06-09

HOTEL

Ithaca Holiday Inn
222 S. Cayuga St.
Ithaca, NY 14850

Check-in time is 3p; Check-out Noon
TEL: 607-272-1000
Fax: 607-277-1275 (guest)

SUNDAY

Sunday afternoon I will be taking interested parties on
a tour of the local wineries. I suggest that we meet for
lunch (Rebecca has suggested Moosewood Restaurant, a famous
local vegetarian restaurant within easy walking distance
of the hotel) and leave for the wineries from there (on the
theory that it's always better to drink on a full stomach!)
From the tour we will go to my house for a party where some
of my other colleagues will join us.

MONDAY

Our meeting will be held at Cornell Information Science,
301 College Ave., Ithaca (tel.: contact is Rosemary Adessa,
607-255-9555). We have a conference room with wireless and
wired connections that work with dhcp. If you want to be
able to use wireless, we'll need to have you registered
for our network before you come. To register, end Rosemary
[rosemary@cs.cornell.edu] your MAC address (At the start
button, go to run and type in: cmd at the prompt type in:
ipconfig/all. What we need is the Physical Address..... (i.e.
00-06-5B-A1-61-54 ). We also have a projector and screen,
lots of whiteboard space, and a large conference table.

You should meet in the lobby by 8 a.m. for the hotel shuttle
which will bring you to campus. Those of you with rental cars
should contact Rosemary if you intend to drive up here instead
of taking the shuttle--parking is scarce and we'll need to
tell you how to get in and where to park. We are within walking
distance of the hotel but it's almost straight up, so only the
determined should attempt it. If you're a breakfast eater it
would be wise to eat at the hotel or elsewhere downtown prior
to meeting the shuttle--we'll have coffee and tea available
but not breakfast (there is a small deli in the building
for those of you who prefer eating later in the morning).
Start of the meeting is scheduled for 8:30.

Dinner Monday evening is at the Boatyard Grill (on the water),
courtesy of NSDL.

TUESDAY

The routine on Tuesday will be much the same, unless we've
made some adjustments on Monday. Those of you who have Tuesday
afternoon or evening flights should talk to Rosemary or Anat
about arrangements to go to the airport--they'll make sure
you get there in time.

CONTACTS

You should be able to reach me at 1-607-387-9207 over the
weekend or possibly on my cell phone (I don't usually leave it
on for incoming calls but will this weekend): 1-607-275-6580.

for the days of the meeting, use the ones below:

are doing their utmost to make sure we have a successful and
pleasant meeting!
