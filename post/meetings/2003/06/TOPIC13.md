TOPIC 13. Strategic role of Usage Board (Makx)

   As Managing Director of DCMI, Makx will lead a discussion
   of the strategic role of the Usage Board for DCMI in
   the medium term. Some of this discussion can take place
   during breaks and at meals, but we should probably consider
   drafting a planning document over the next few months.

   Questions to consider include:
   - How does the UB relate to strategic planning of DCMI as an
     organisation?
   - Should the UB contribute more clearly to strategic objectives
     by soliciting proposals in certain areas?
   - Where will proposals come from in the future?

   Time needed: 45"
