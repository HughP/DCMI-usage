## "Using Dublin Core" Second draft revision, 2003

There are currently five documents, corresponding to the original supporting documents underlying the current version of "Using Dublin Core". However, because the file names and structure are outside the DCMI website, some of the links between documents do not work. Re-linking will be the last part of the process--at this stage, content is the focus.

The current documents are:

- [The main text](Using_Dublin_Core-rev1.html)
- The three documents describing the 15 elements 
  - [Content](Elements-Content.html)
  - [Instantiation](Elements-Instantiation.html)

  - [Intellectual property](Elements-IntellProp.html)
- [The document describing qualification and qualifiers](Qualifiers-Rev.html)
