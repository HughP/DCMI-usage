      <h2 align="center">Proposal: Captured qualifier for Date
      element</h2>

      <h3 align="center">13 April 2002</h3>

      <p align="left">This proposal is for review by Dublin Core
      community. It proposes a new element refinement Captured for
      the DC:Date element that is included in the proposed
      DC-Library Application Profile. This review period is 15
      April-11 May 2002.</p>

            date than that in which it was digitized or a

            <td>Date.Creation: many library applications consider
            date created that of the intellectual content (this
            interpretation is specified in the DC-Lib application
            profile). It is important to also include the date of
            capture and to distinguish it as such.</td>

            this because of the lack of a qualifier. This element
            refinement has been requested on several occasions.
            There is a known application (Colorado Digitization
            Project) that has used Date.Digitized locally for this
