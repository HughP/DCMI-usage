## 1. Introduction and Objective

This document describes a proposal to the Dublin Core Usage Board to provide a new resource type in the DCMI Type Vocabulary [2] which would identify the genre of a resource as being a physical, 3-dimensional object.

The DCMI Type Vocabulary, which is a DCMI recommendation, provides a general, cross-domain list of approved terms which may be used as values for the Resource Type element to identify the genre of a resource. Currently this list does not include a value which can be used to signify that a resource is a physical, 3-dimensional object.

## 2. The Proposal

It is proposed that the DCMI Type Vocabulary be extended to include a new resource type:

<dl>
      <dt><b>Physical Object</b></dt>

      <dd>
<b>Name:</b> PhysicalObject<br>
       <b>Label:</b> Physical Object<br>
       <b>Definition:</b> A non-human, three-dimensional object or
      substance. For example - a computer, the great pyramid, a
      sculpture, wheat. Note that digital representations of, or
      surrogates for, these things should use <i>Image, Text</i> or
      one of the other types.</dd>
    </dl>
  
  

Practitioners who use Dublin Core to describe resources have found that there is not currently a suitable item within the DCMI Type Vocabulary encoding scheme to indicate that a resource is a physical, 3-dimensional object. In particular, this has been noted by the Museums community, but requests for such a type have also been made from other domains such as Libraries.
