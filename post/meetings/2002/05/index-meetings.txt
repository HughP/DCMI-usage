    The Usage Board met at DC2001 in Tokyo to discuss issues of
    process (ie, a Web-based fast-track procedure for
    registering encoding schemes) and review an extensive
    proposal from the DC-Government Working Group.

    At a DCMI meeting in Madeira, February 2001, the Advisory
    Committee approved the re-constitution of the old Usage
    Committee as a smaller Usage Board, the goal of which would
    be to meet twice per year face-to-face and review proposals
    for metadata term semantics in a timely, principled, and
    well-documented manner.  The first meeting of the new Usage
    Board was held in May 2001 at OCLC in Dublin, Ohio.  The
    Board discussed mission and process, an application profile,
    changed one definition, and approved three new metadata terms
    [1-5].

2000 January through July, DCMI mailing lists

    A Usage Committee of twenty-four interested members of the
    DCMI Advisory Committee held a discussion over the Web and
    approved a set of first set of DCMI Qualifiers [3,6] and a
    controlled vocabulary of values for the Type element [5,7].
    The discussion, from late 1999 through follow-up in July
    2000, is archived on the (now-defunct) Mailbase service [1].
    The voting results for individual qualifiers, with review
    comments, are archived at DCMI [2].  The set of qualifiers
    was issued as a DCMI Recommendation on 11 July [3], as
    described in a press release at that time [4].
