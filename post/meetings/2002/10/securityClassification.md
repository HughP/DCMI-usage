## Issues [[top](http://dublincore.org/groups/government/#top)]

For full implementation of this refinement, a namespace is needed. Inclusion in DC will mean the availability of a practical, usable namespace.

## Remarks about qualifier from DC GOV community 2001.08.01-2002.08.01 [[top](http://dublincore.org/groups/government/#top)]
 Correspondents have questioned the name of this resource, asking if 'Security classification" would be more widely understood. Protective marking is a more generic term, This is because things like 'commercial-in-confidence' or 'personal' aren't security classifications is the strictest sense, but do control access to the resource and its logical to put them in this refinement. 

6 sept 2001. John Roberts:  
 In respect of the 'Protective marking' refinement for Rights, we agree with the refinement, but question the label suggested. The meaning of 'Protective marking' is not readily understood to a New Zealand user - why was this term preferred to, for example, 'Security classification'?  
  
 6 sept 2001 Diane Boehr  
 :B.3 Rights:Why not call "Protective marking" "Security Classification"? Isn't that clearer?  
  
 14 sept 2001 Nancy Brodie  
 There is a need to indicate access rights for resources that are not "open" and these possible access limitations are not based on copyright. So it is a good idea to specify some other rights. Achieving generic terminology here will be difficult since rights are most often based on national legislation. I agree with other comments that "Protective marking" is a bit obscure. "classification" or "level of protection" are more meaningful terms to us. We use ATI (Access to Information) not FOI although FOI is understood by specialists.
