    ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom (and Mikael) to continue work on
    Simple Dublin Core.

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom to amend the naming policy (DCMI
    names should not differ only with respect to case).

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom to correct RDF schemas of DCMI Metadata
    Terms to use blank node with publisher.

    ISSUE 2008-09-21: Rendering of Wiki pages using the DSP
    syntax does not capture all of the DSP detail and uses
    different labelling.  It would be useful to hyperlink
    labels in the DSP rendered page to the DSP documentation
    itself.  Also, to hyperlink description template labels
    within the wiki page itself, e.g. creator to agent
    description.
    ACTION 2009-04-22: Tom to turn Pete's proposal at
    https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0903&L=DC-USAGE&P=982
    into a decision document for finalization on next telecon.

    ISSUE 2008-09-21: Is it good practice to provide a
    Value VES in addition to a Value URI, or is it arguably
    redundant?  (Example: "Entity Type" under "Scholarly Work"
    in SWAP, http://dublincore.org/scholarwiki/SWAPDSP).
    Guidance on this point may belong in the application
    profile guidelines.
