Domains and ranges (Akira)

   The Domain Vocabulary has been revised in light of
   Barcelona decisions [1] and posted for Public Comment
   through 30 July [2].  A range of rdfs:Literal has been
   proposed for dcterms:identifier [3].  Pete has written
   a note describing the "special cases" (title, date,
   description, and their subproperties) [4]. (From the
   notes: "There are two audiences for this comment: (1)
   multiple script communities and (2) SW community asking:
   best practice for unspecified ranges.")

     1) It is problematic to use a property with both literal and non-literal
        values, from OWL-DL position and also from basic query and processing
        standpoint.
     2) We should consider to separate properties for these cases.

     1) What most people think as a literal is not just a sequence of
        characters, but a text in some language.
