About this document

The DCMI Board of Trustees, at its meeting in Seeheim, Germany,
in April 2005, revisited DCMI's mission statement, extending
the mission explicitly to encompass resource description. In
light of this revised mission, the Trustees also discussed the
need of DCMI Working Groups to find a home for descriptive
and other, application- or domain-specific terms that they
define in the course of developing their Application Profiles.

The absence of such a home is perceived as a crucial bottleneck
delaying the forward progress of Working Groups and the
practical adoption of Application Profiles. At the same time,
the DCMI Board of Trustees felt there was an opportunity
for DCMI to increase its value to the community by offering
a solution to this need, also acknowledging that care needs
to be taken to do this in a sensible and sustainable way.

The Board of Trustees tasked the DCMI Directorate to elaborate
a proposal to address these issues and identify the actions
that need to be taken to establish a home for such terms as
a service to the community.

This proposal is work in progress, to be revised after
discussion within the DCMI Directorate, Board of Trustees,
Usage Board, and Advisory Board.

Caveat: This document refers to the notion of "namespace"
in line with the existing DCMI Namespace Policy [5]. As
discussed in the Usage Board and Architecture Working Group,
however, this use of "namespace" has been seen as needing
clarification.  Prior to implementation, the name of the
proposed service should perhaps be reconsidered in light of
such a clarification.

Background: the current situation

The mission of DCMI has long emphasized resource discovery
across domains.  Accordingly, the DCMI Usage Board has used
"cross-domain validity" and "usefulness for resource discovery"
as twin criteria for evaluating terms proposed for inclusion in
the set of DCMI Terms [1,12,13].  Terms approved for inclusion
are assigned URIs formed on the basis of three base URIs
[2,3,4] and maintained in accordance with the DCMI Namespace
Policy [5].

DCMI Working Groups, on the other hand, typically define their
task as one of developing an "Application Profile" for use
in a particular domain or application, e.g., for describing
government information, learning materials, library resources,
or resource collections. In order to do this, Working Groups
often need to coin new terms for descriptive needs unmet by
existing vocabularies.

To the extent that such additional terms are not demonstrably
useful both for "resource discovery" and "across domains",
they have hitherto not been considered good candidates for
inclusion in the central set of DCMI Terms.  Some such terms
have been rejected by the Usage Board for not meeting these
criteria, while others have been approved on the basis of
a relaxed interpretation of the criteria.  Some terms of a
clearly domain-specific or purely descriptive nature were
simply never proposed.

Until now, the option available to Working Groups
developing such terms has been to declare them in non-DCMI
namespaces. Guidelines laying out options for doing so have
been drafted [6].  However, finding an appropriate home for new
terms -- e.g. an institution which can at a minimum guarantee
that URIs will not be reassigned and will remain resolvable
to documentation on the Web for the foreseeable future --
has proven to be a significant hurdle.

At the same time, the Usage Board has developed and begun to
test processes for reviewing Application Profiles [7,8,9]. The
DCMI Abstract Model [10], which describes the nature and
composition of "DCMI metadata descriptions", was approved
as a DCMI Recommendation in March 2005 and provides a solid
and agreed basis for such reviews. In principle, Usage Board
review is aimed at establishing whether a given application
profile for such descriptions is in conformance with the
Abstract Model.

Proposed approach

In order to be able to provide a home for terms outside of the criteria
governing the inclusion in the core set, DCMI needs to take a number of
actions and formulate a number of policies. The Directorate proposes
the following approach:

1. To host namespaces for terms outside of the core set under
   the name "DCMI Extension Namespaces".

2. To define and describe DCMI Extension Namespaces in a revised
   and extended DCMI Namespace Policy [5].

3. To assign a base URI for DCMI Extension Namespaces and
   formulate a procedure by which new terms will be assigned
   URIs -- also as an extension to the DCMI Namespace Policy
   [5].  The proposed base URI for DCMI Extension Namespaces is
   http://dublincore.org/extension/.

4. To formulate guidance on the naming and identification of
   terms in DCMI Extension Namespaces to the extent that these
   topics are not already covered by the DCMI Namespace
   Policy [5] and the DCMI Policy on Naming Terms [11], and
   to formulate and document a model for versioning historical
   descriptions of DCMI Extension Namespaces.

5. To develop and clarify the criteria, formal processes and
   workflow by which a DCMI Extension Namespace is created, terms
   are reviewed and approved, approved terms are added to that
   namespace, and a DCMI Extension Namespace, once created, can be
   edited or changed over time. This involves describing the
   roles of a DCMI Strategic Activity (i.e. a DCMI Working
   Group) and the Usage Board in the creation and review of
   terms for a DCMI Extension Namespace.

6. To formulate a policy to define and clarify the persistence
   of DCMI Extension Namespaces and the maintenance responsibility
   that DCMI takes towards these namespaces, in particular
   clarifying the respective roles and responsibilities
   of the DCMI Usage Board in the medium- and longer-term
   maintenance of DCMI Extension Namespaces given that DCMI
   Strategic Activities will usually have a limited lifespan.

7. To define the notion of a DCMI Strategic Activity,
   involving the description of any duties or obligations
   between DCMI as an organization and the leaders or members
   of a DCMI Strategic Activity, along with any clarifications
   regarding membership and operational procedures of Strategic
   Activities. This may involve obtaining commitment for the
   management of the Strategic Activity from a institutional
   stakeholder, possibly a DCMI Affiliate.

Discussion

In recognition of the long-term maintenance and workload issues
raised by the prospect of additional DCMI-owned namespaces,
it is suggested that access to such namespaces be limited
to activities (i.e. Working Groups) designated by DCMI as
"strategic activities".  In this approach, a DCMI Strategic
Activity can present an Application Profile to the Usage
Board for review for conformance to the Abstract Model, and
any new terms in a profile judged to be "conforming" would
be eligible for declaration in a DCMI Extension Namespace. The
Collection Description Working Group has been suggested as
a test case for the status of DCMI Strategic Activity.

It seems reasonable to build in safeguards to avoid that DCMI
be confronted with the obligation to maintain a rapidly growing
number of additional terms over time. Firstly, the Usage
Board, currently chartered as a central, generically-scoped
committee, cannot be presumed to have all the necessary
expertise to maintain terms that may be application- or
domain-specific. Secondly, care should be taken not to create
an overwhelming workload for the Usage Board in maintaining
potentially rapidly growing set of terms.

It can be expected that terms proposed for DCMI Extension
Namespaces will typically be terms "around the edges" of Dublin
Core -- the "missing pieces" of the particular Application
Profile under development. A DCMI Extension Namespace might
typically have between one and a dozen or so properties. In
addition, a DCMI Extension Namespace may hold terms for small
controlled vocabularies of values. These terms most likely
will only make sense in the context of the Application Profile
for which they were created. Therefore, DCMI should put more
emphasis on Application Profiles -- by assigning them status,
describing them on Web pages, and featuring them as examples
of good practice -- than on DCMI Extension Namespaces per se.

Appendix: Usage Board discussions about "namespace hosting"

The problem of declaring and maintaining terms outside of the central
vocabularies has been discussed at various times by the Usage Board.
In January 2002, the position of the Usage Board was as follows [15]:

    When the Usage Board approves a term, that term will go
    into the dcterms namespace (or perhaps into a new namespace
    in some exceptional circumstances).  If the UB does not
    approve a term, then projects will have to create 'a new
    (non-DCMI) namespace' -- which means a namespace with a
    non-DCMI namespace URI, which means that it isn't hosted
    on the DCMI site.

    In order to avoid confusion, such non-DCMI namespaces
    should not be allowed to carry 'DC' in their name.

    Views of non-DCMI namespaces may well be available thru
    the DCMI Registry, but the implications for review process
    and registry interface have yet to be worked out.

In subsequent discussion between the Usage Board and the
Directorate, it was agreed that DCMI as an organization
(and not the Usage Board in particular) might make a
strategic decision to offer Namespace Hosting as a service to
working groups as long as care were taken to ensure that the
distinction between DCMI Term namespaces and a hosted namespace
were never ambiguous (for example, by avoiding the use of
"DC-" in the title of a namespace).  It was agreed that hosted
namespaces would be outside the jurisdiction of the Usage
Board inasmuch the Usage Board would not be responsible for
responding to requests for editorial changes to hosted terms.

At its meeting of May 2002, the Usage Board pictured this as a
model consisting of a core (the Dublin Core), a semi-periphery
of additional DCMI terms, and a periphery of non-DCMI terms
identified under the domain of a yet-to-be-created, DCMI-owned
but non-DCMI-branded namespace host.

For several reasons, DCMI did not implement this idea at
the time.  It was not clear by whose authority, if not
the Usage Board's, terms were to be declared in a hosted
namespace.  Working groups are by definition temporary, so
maintenance responsibility, to the extent it were implied,
would by default revert to DCMI as a whole, and therefore to
the Usage Board.  It was also recognized that a DCMI-hosted
namespace would offer a solution attractive for many working
groups, generating a potentially unmanageable demand for
access to the namespace host.

Furthermore, it was not clear by what criteria and processes
DCMI could -- if not via the Usage Board -- regulate such
access and ensure at least a minimal quality of terms declared
in a hosted namespace.  Nor was it clear by what processes or
criteria DCMI might assert an implied right to deprecate or
even remove terms proven by implementation to be problematic.

In a nutshell, the prospect of creating a DCMI-owned
namespace host in the absence of a clear process model
seemed to risk associating DCMI with a potentially large
number of unmaintained (and unmaintainable) namespaces.
Taken individually, these namespaces would look fragmentary
-- the "missing pieces" of this or that application profile.
Collectively, they would present an incoherent whole.

(One recurring variant of the Namespace Hosting idea
has been for DCMI to create a namespace where working
groups can "park" new or experimental terms without going
through a formal approval process in order to make new or
experimental terms citable by URI, thus supporting a less
"bureaucratic", more bottom-up, market-driven approach to
growing vocabularies. However this scenario, according to
which working groups would get direct access to a namespace
host, seems even more problematic than others.  This variant
is discussed in [16].)

After periodic consideration of alternatives, the Usage
Board has always circled back to the notion that in the end,
terms must be maintained, and it should always be clear who
is maintaining the terms -- at any rate for all terms which
have or could be perceived to have branding by DCMI. In the
absence of alternative solutions within DCMI, the Usage
Board has followed the conservative course of limiting
its vocabulary management activities to a small and slowly
growing vocabulary of terms in accordance with reasonably
strict policies, processes, and principles.
