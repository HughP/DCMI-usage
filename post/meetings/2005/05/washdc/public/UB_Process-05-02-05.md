## Part 1-Usage Board: Overview, Meetings, Documentation

### 1. <a id="one." name="one.">Usage Board Membership</a>
> **1.1.** The UB will consist of at least seven and no more  than eleven people (nine is ideal) appointed by the DCMI  Directorate.  
> **1.2.** Usage Board member terms shall be for  two years, renewable once. Initial appointments will be made so as to stagger  terms.  
> **1.3.** Members should be selected based on the  following criteria:
> 
> > **1.3.1.** Knowledgeable concerning the development history  and purpose of the DC element set and its relationship to the metadata world  at large;  
> > **1.3.2.** Related to a metadata community  relevant to DCMI;  
> > **1.3.3.** Willing and able to commit time  and energy to the functions of the UB;  
> > **1.3.4.** Able to  communicate verbally and in writing in English well enough to prepare  documents and discuss complex issues in a group  setting;  
> > **1.3.5.** Geographic and domain distribution of  members is relevant but will not override other criteria.
> 
> **1.4.** The UB Chair will be appointed from one of the  membership by the DCMI Directorate. The term of the chair shall be for two  years, renewable once.   
> **1.5.** Liaisons from DCMI affiliates may be appointed by DCMI management in consultation with the Usage Board Chair.
> 
> > **1.5.1.** Liaisons are non-voting and do not serve as shepherds, but are encouraged to participate in discussion on the Usage Board list and at meetings. **1.6.** For internal communication the  UB uses the closed mailing list dc-usage@jiscmail.ac.uk. The messages are  archived and publicly available at [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html).
### 2. <a id="two." name="two.">Meetings</a>
> **2.1.** Scheduling
> 
> > **2.1.1.** Meetings should be held at least twice a year.
> > 
> > > **2.1.1.1.** One meeting should be scheduled during the  annual DC general workshop/conference.  
> > > **2.1.1.2.** The  second should be scheduled at a different time of the year, preferably  close to other conferences, so as to make attendance convenient for as  many members as possible.  
> > > **2.1.1.3.** Scheduling should  be done far enough in advance so that as many members as possible may be  present.
> 
> **2.2.** Funding for regular UB members attendance at meetings should be supported as much as possible by DCMI.
> 
> > **2.2.1.** Funding for the attendance of Liaisons at UB meetings should be supported by their institution. **2.3.** Meeting agenda > **2.3.1.** The UB Chair maintains the agenda, which cites  links to relevant supporting documentation, including JISCMAIL  postings.  
> > **2.3.2.** All materials pointed to in the agenda  are archived at http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/ after the final  pre-meeting version of the agenda has been distributed. After the meeting,  the archive version of the agenda is edited to point to these archive  copies.
> 
> **2.4.** Attendance by members
> 
> > **2.4.1.** Members must attend at least one meeting in a  given year to maintain membership in good  standing.  
> > **2.4.2.** Members who miss two meetings in  succession may be replaced by the DC Directorate.
> 
> **2.5.** Attendance by others
> 
> > **2.5.1.** Attendance at UB meetings by other than the UB is  by invitation.
> > 
> > > **2.5.1.1.** People interested in attending should request  an invitation via the UB Chair or the Managing Director.
> > 
> > **2.5.2.** Participation in discussion of proposals by any  interested parties is encouraged.
> 
> **2.6.** Agenda preparation and distribution
> 
> > **2.6.1.** The UB chair is responsible for preparing the  meeting agendas and assigning shepherds to  proposals.  
> > **2.6.2.** Agenda items shall include the name  and email address of the UB member responsible for shepherding the proposal  through the UB process.  
> > **2.6.3.** Agendas shall be  available at http://www.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/ a few weeks before  the meeting.
> 
> **2.7.** Important decisions will be assigned a number for  citation purposes and documented on the DCMI website.
### 3. <a id="three." name="three.">Categories of Usage Board Decisions</a>
<a id="recommended" name="recommended"></a>> **3.1.**  **_Recommended_:** Elements,  Element Refinements, and DCMI-maintained Vocabulary Terms (e.g., member terms  of the DCMI Type Vocabulary) useful for resource discovery across  domains.  
> <a id="conforming" name="conforming"></a> **3.2.*****Conforming_:** Elements, Element Refinements and  Application Profiles may be assigned a status of conforming. Elements and  Element Refinements assigned a status of conforming are those for which an  implementation community has a demonstrated need and which conform to the  grammar of Elements and Element Refinements, though without necessarily  meeting the stricter criteria of usefulness across domains or usefulness for  resource discovery.  
> <a id="obsolete" name="obsolete"></a> **3.3.*****Obsolete_:** For Elements and Element Refinements that  have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete. Such terms will remain  in the registry for use in interpreting legacy metadata.  
> <a id="registered" name="registered"></a> **3.4.*****Registered_:** Used for Vocabulary Encoding Schemes and  language translations for which the DCMI provides information but not  necessarily a specific recommendation.

> **6.2.** For the purposes of review by the Usage Board:
> 
> > **6.2.1.** The Usage Board is interested in reviewing  application profiles that make substantial use of Dublin Core elements. The  review of application profiles by the Usage Board serves to:
> > 
> > > **6.2.1.1.** analyze the usage of Dublin Core within  significant implementations;  
> > > **6.2.1.2.** assign a DCMI stamp of approval;  
> > > **6.2.1.3.** promote the sharing of  application profiles between communities; and  
> > > **6.2.1.4.** identify new terms as candidates for inclusion in DCMI  namespaces.
> > 
> > **6.2.2.** Application profiles must provide, for each term,  an identifier of the element set where it is defined, ideally in the form of  URIs for individual terms.  
> > **6.2.3.** If the terms in an  application profile describe anything other than generic "resources" (the  typical domain of Dublin Core), the application profile must make this  clear. This is particularly important if an application profile is based on  a data model that describes multiple classes of resources, such as agents or  collections.  
> > **6.2.4.** It is recommended that application  profiles be prepared using the Dublin Core Application Profile guidelines published by CEN [http://www.cenorm.be/cenorm/businessdomains/businessdomains/isss/cwa/cwa14855.asp].   
> > **6.2.5.** Each application profile must provide, or  point to, a short text that describes:
> > 
> > > **6.2.5.1.** The context and purposes in which the  application profile is used or is likely to be  used.  
> > > **6.2.5.2.** The organizations or individuals  involved in its development and a capsule history  thereof.  
> > > **6.2.5.3.** Any arrangements, policies, or  intentions regarding the future development and maintenance of the  application profile.
> 
> **6.3.** Review of Application Profiles by the Usage Board
> 
> > **6.3.1.** An application profile is "well-formed" if it is  presented in accordance with the broad and flexible requirements outlined  above. These presentation requirements may become more specific as "good  practice" emerges over time.  
> > **6.3.2.** Usage Board review  focuses on the use of terms related to Dublin Core terms and on any data  models that provide a context for those terms. The Usage Board is agnostic  about the use of terms not directly related to Dublin Core; strictly  speaking such terms are outside the scope of Usage Board  review.  
> > **6.3.3.** The use of terms related to Dublin Core  (such as refinements of Dublin Core elements, or Dublin Core elements that  have been constrained for particular contexts) will be evaluated from the  standpoint of semantic conformance, grammatical principle (eg, "dumb-down"),  clarity, and good practice.
> 
> **6.4.** Publication and use of Usage Board Reviews
> 
> > **6.4.1.** An application profiles that "pass" review will  be assigned the status of 'conforming'.
> > 
> > > <font color="red"><strong>6.4.1.1.</strong> The status of 'conforming' indicates a Usage Board assessment of the application profile as of the date of its submission for review.<br> <strong>6.4.1.2.</strong> Changes to already 'conforming' application profiles require further Usage Board review of the application profile in whole or in part according to the processes and criteria outlined in sections 6.1through 6.3. </font> **6.4.2.** For  application profiles that "pass" review, the Usage Board will publish a  Review on a Web page for application profiles.  
> > **6.4.3.**  Each Review will include, at a minimum: > **6.4.3.1.** Any comments from the Usage Board on the  application profile.  
> > > **6.4.3.2.** Pointers to locally  archived copies of the application profile as originally submitted and (if  necessary) as subsequently amended in light of Usage Board  comments.  
> > > **6.4.3.3.** A pointer to the "latest version"  of an application profile held by its  maintainers.
