I'm pleased to report that the DCMI Date Working Group has
completed work on a matter referred to it by the DCMI Usage
Board.

After deliberation it is the sense of the Date WG that ISO
8601 Data elements and interchange formats -- Information
interchange -- Representation of dates and times should not
be registered for:

*   dc:date
*   dcterms:temporal

The WG bases its decision chiefly on the following findings:

*   Scope: Though ISO 8601 provides for useful and in-scope
    cases of date information, the standard also provides
    for cases (e.g., duration) which are out of scope for
    dc:date and dcterms:temporal.

*   Practical application: The large universe of values
    permitted -- and the authorization of multiple
    expressions of these values -- by ISO 8601 potentially
    poses impractical application and validation-by-software
    burdens on agencies wishing to make use of dc:date and
    dcterms:temporal.

The Date WG believes that future registration of profiles
of ISO 8601 and/or other, less complex encoding schemes will
better serve the Dublin Core community rather than registration
of an "all-ISO 8601" encoding scheme.
