I don't remember either I'm afraid.

Looking at your edited version now, I have the following comments.

I think that the comment for software is completely broken

Label:  Software
        Definition:     A computer program in source or compiled form
                        which may be available for installation 
                        non-transiently on another machine.
        Comment:        For software which exists only to create an
                        interactive environment, use interactive instead.

The last sentence should at least say 'Interactive Resource'.
But the more fundamental problem is that the comment mixes
up descriptions of the 'software' from descriptions of the
'thing created by running the software', i.e. the 'interactive
resource'.  In some situations it'll be appropriate to describe
one, in other situations it'll be approapriate to describe
the other - but you can't simply recommend to use one of these
in favour of the other - since they are different resources!

In the comment for Collection

        Label:  Collection
        Definition:     An aggregation of items.
        Comment:        The term collection means that the resource is
                        described as a group; its parts may be separately 
                        described and navigated.

it might be helpful to say "its parts may *also* be separately
described and navigated"?

The comment for Event is very odd.  An Event is *never*
retreivable!  And why does this comment talk about the other
metadata about the event - none of the other comments do this.

The definition for Sound seems to mix up work and manifestation
(or reality and representation, or something) - i.e. a 'sound'
and a 'sound file'. The definition sounds like the latter,
but I suspect the former is also intended??

Label:  Sound
        Definition:     A resource whose content is primarily intended to
                        be rendered as audio.
        Comment:        For example - a music playback file format, an
                        audio compact disc, and recorded speech or sounds.

Can I use DC to describe birdsong?  Or can I only use it to describe a
recording of birdsong?  If the Sound type only applies to the latter
(which is what the definition sounds like it means) then what is the type
of the former?

Thanks, Andy.  I'm not quite sure how to approach your comments in the
course of these edits.  Several go to the heart of terms semantics.  It was
my understanding that what Diane and I were changed to do was rather
ministerial in terms of moving text more appropriate to the comments from
the current descriptions and to make the texts more consistent.  In doing
the first round, we tried to be as loyal to the current semantics as we
could.  Your points are well made; but I guess I am not sure whether Diane
and I should go off re-crafting semantics.  Perhaps there might be a moment
on tomorrow's call to clarify the charge in light of your comments...or to
postpone discussion until D.C. in a few weeks.

Agreed.  Fair point.

But I think that my comments about Software, Collection and Event fall
into the non-semantic category?   The only really contentious comment (of
mine) is the one about sound??
