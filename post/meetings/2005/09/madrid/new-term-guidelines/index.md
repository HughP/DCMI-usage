As promised I'm attempting to catch up with the most recently 
announced element terms prior to Madrid. Below is what I've come up 
with, and I'd appreciate the attention of your experienced eyeballs.

Note that for Instructional Method I've used term values from some of 
the GEM vocabularies, using the three facets that they use. For the 
Accrual trilogy I've used terms from the vocabularies in the original 
proposals, figuring that these reflected the sense of the group. I 
have to say that the comment we approved, which is essentially a best 
practice statement, makes the writing of a guideline very difficult! 
I'm not crazy about the results of my efforts and would really 
welcome suggestions for improvement, and particularly language that 
might better differentiate between the three and avoid some pitfalls 
for the uninitiated.

Also please note below the message that I am no longer at my old job 
and phone number, but am present working at home until I get a new 
office assignment at the library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructional Method

Element Description:&lt;/em&gt; A process, used to engender knowledge, 
attitudes and skills, that the resource is designed to support. 
Instructional Method will typically include ways of presenting
instructional materials or conducting instructional activities, 
patterns of learner-to-learner and learner-to-instructor 
interactions, and mechanisms by which group and individual levels of 
learning are measured. Instructional methods include all aspects of 
the instruction and learning
processes from planning and implementation through evaluation and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

Guidelines for content creation: Best practice is to use terms from 
controlled vocabularies,
whether developed for the use of a particular project or in general 
use in an educational context.

Examples:

InstructionalMethod="Experiential learning"
InstructionalMethod="Observation"
InstructionalMethod="Large group instruction"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accrual Method

Element Description: The method by which items are added to a 
collection. Recommended best practice is to use a value from a 
controlled vocabulary.

Guidelines for content creation:

Terms from controlled vocabularies may be developed for the use of a 
particular project or in general use in an cultural materials context.

Examples:

AccrualMethod="Deposit"
AccrualMethod="Purchase"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accrual Periodicity

Element Description: The frequency with which items are added to a 
collection. Recommended best practice is to use a value from a 
controlled vocabulary.

Guidelines for content creation:Terms from controlled vocabularies 
may be developed for
the use of a particular project or in general use in an cultural 
materials context.

Examples:

AccrualPeriodicity="Annual"
AccrualPeriodicity="Irregular"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accrual Policy

Element Description: The policy governing the addition of items to a 
collection. Recommended best practice is to use a value from a 
controlled vocabulary.

Guidelines for content creation: Terms from controlled vocabularies 
may be developed for the use
of a particular project or in general use in an cultural materials context.

Examples:
