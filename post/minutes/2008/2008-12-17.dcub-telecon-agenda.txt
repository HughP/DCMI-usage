Review of DCMI Libraries properties

1.1 Date Captured

Conclusion: Proposal does not provide well-defined notion
of "captured", but based on our discussion, Option 3
(dcterms:captured as subproperty of dcterms:created) seems
most appropriate approach.

Issues: Meaning of "capture" is not clear: "digitisation" is
one case; "snapshotting" Web sites etc is another. Difficult
to generalise.

Andrew: related to isFormatOf - same content, different format.

ACTION 2008-09-21 (Andrew): To draft definition/comment for proposed
property in time to present for discussion with DC Lib
Community at their DC-2008 meeting.

1.2 Holding Location

DECISION: Suggest use of agls:availability.

ACTION 2008-09-21 (Diane): To draft recommendation that DC Lib community
use the agls:availability property with literal value in
time to present for discussion with DC Lib Community at
their DC-2008 meeting. Text should point out difficulties of
proposed definition (e.g. ambiguity between organisation and
location) and provide our interpretation of intended function
of "holding location".

1.3 Version

DECISION: Agreed to present property as proposed for public
comment and finalise in telecon.

ACTION 2008-09-21 (Julie): To draft comment in time to present for
discussion with DC Lib Community at their DC-2008 meeting.

Review of Accessibility properties

RESOLVED: Co-ordinate development of property and VES with
AGLS. Andrew to shepherd.  (Tom will report)

Step 1: Liaise with AGLS re co-ordinated publication of
property dcterms:accessibility and AGLS VES.

Step 2: UB to ask AGLS to confirm desired VES.

Step 3: UB and AGLS to jointly agree natural language
definition and formal range to express semantics of
resource-valuerelationship. (Note: currently apparent
overlap between values for "accessibility" and "accessMode"
properties.)

Goal: Co-ordinated publication of DCMI property and AGLS VES
along with simple usable documentation.

Review of Scholarly Works Application Profile (SWAP)

ACTION 2008-09-21: Julie or Diane should write up a sentence for the
review pointing out that the info:uri for the OpenURL Framework
is nowhere declared as a datatype or SES, but that in our
interpretation of the documentation (see citation in review)
the use of the URI in this way is consistent with the concept
of a datatype.

SWAP DSP Errata:
1) Remove trailing slashes from URL for Entity Type
2) Typographical errors
3) Remove VES constraint for IsExpressedAs etc.
4) Remove null values for Language
5) Type, Status and accessRights - use of VES should be optional
6) Revise SWAP use of dc:type for both expression entity type
   and resource type wrt property list constraint matching issue
   outlined below
7) Bibliographic Citation DC-Text example should have
   two statements rather than a single value string; and
   eprint-specific recommendation should read 'or' rather than
   'and/or'
8) Some of the DC-Text examples in SWAP use "ResourceRef ( x )"
   for the "blank node" case.  At some point this was changed in DC-Text;
   it should use "ValueId ( x )".  See example 23 in DC-Text spec.

ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom to correct profile review criteria
section on statement templates: [mandatory] property
constraints - one of the following: ...

ISSUE: Is constraint 6.3 required?

ISSUE: Is it redundant to have a Value VES constraint in
addition to a Value URI constraint, or good practice? Guidance
on this point may belong in the application profile guidelines.

ISSUE: Rendering of the Wiki pages does not capture all of
the DSP detail and uses different labelling.  It would be
useful to hyperlink labels in the DSP rendered page to the
DSP documentation itself.  Also, to hyperlink description
template labels within the wiki page itself, e.g. creator to
agent description.

ISSUE: Criteria should reflect that a property list
constraint should be used once only within a description
template. Guidance should be given to application profile
creators on this issue, e.g. using the subject example where
an application profile wants to require an LCSH term and have
an option to add a free tag or a different vocabulary term.
Consider inclusion of this guidance on the current proposed
guidelines for application profiles.  One option is to make
the constraint human-readable only. Clarify with Mikael before
progressing this.

RESOLVED: SWAP conforms.

ACTION 2008-09-21 (Tom): Prepare final review document, to be finalised on
a telecon pending revised SWAP document and list of corrections.

ACTION 2008-09-21 (Julie as SWAP editor): Corrections to SWAP (as above).
