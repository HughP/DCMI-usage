              DCMI Usage Board Meeting, 29-30 April 2006, Seattle

How can we make it easy for users to prepare application
profiles?  These are extant documents that relate to
application profiles:

What is an application profile?
    OLD: "list of terms"

    NEW: "Statement of what set of things are being described,
    and a list of terms that going to be used to describe those
    things."  If so, then we need an application profile
    for an application profile.

    Is it: 
    -- Rules by which you create a description set for an application?
    -- The makeup of a description set?

    Agreed: Something like `Rules by which a description set is
    "defined"`.

    Description of this DCAP
        dc:creator    = Samuel Adams
        dc:title      = My application profile
        dc:description
    Model (e.g., entity-relationship model)
    -- Model of Entity 1
       Property 1
       Property 2
       Property 3
    -- Model of Entity 2
       Property 1
       Property 2
       Property 3
    DescriptionUsage
       Description 1
           Occurrence = 1
           Class of described resources = collection (rdf:type, or new term?)
           PropertyUsage
               Uses Property
               Label for this DCAP

ISSUES
-- Need QualifiedNameforProperty?
-- Need Qualified Name for Syntax Encoding Scheme?
-- Need to serve properties from the property URI -- i.e.,
   translations (Finnish) must come from DCMI namespace?
-- Is an application profile used for instance metadata
   creation?
-- Do property usages have URI`s?
-- How do you say you must use LCSH?  In Obligation?
-- Do we need "condition" or does it go in "best practices" documents?
-- Need to model Value String Usage and Obligation.
-- RDF representation of the above
-- Regarding "Local Definition": Definition is sacrosanct --
   if you`re using someone else`s properties the definition
   should not be changed
-- Simple DC defaults to describing resources -- so it does 
   not require models of multiple entities.

DOCUMENTATIONAL VS FORMAL STYLE

-- Do we need two styles (for property usages)?  One for humans
   (documentational) and one for machines (formal)?  For example,
   should the documentation include, as part of PropertyUsage:

       Source Label {for information only} [do these by reference]
       Source Definition {for information only} [do these by reference]
       Source Comment {for information only} [do these by reference]

DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE
-- How do we maintain a master copy of this AP of an AP?
   RDF/XML should be the master copy.  Different scenarios:

   1) NSDL Interface -> RDF/XML -> HTML or XML 
   2) Dctext -> RDF/XML-> HTML or XML
   3) Schema Generation Tool -> RDF/XML-> HTML or XML
   4) Human -> RDF/XML-> HTML or XML

   AGREED: RDF/XML should be complete enough to generate XML
   schemas.

AGREED: A separate list of vocabulary encoding schemes can
be derived from Property Usage, so we do not need a separate
list as part of an application profile.

2009-01-29: Changed usageboard/log URIs to usage/minutes URIs.
