Review of Collection Description Application Profile 

    Shepherd: Andrew

    There are discussions about finding a home for
    as-yet-undeclared terms. There is also a move to
    harmonize the CD AP with a NISO draft standard (Tom to
    supply details) [1]. There is overlap between the NISO
    version and the CDAP, with some divergences. In Colima,
    we want to review for conformance, disregarding issue of
    a home for undeclared terms.

    How should we manage the review process? Make a checklist,
    with quantitative ratings? In the coming weeks we'll need to
    divide up the tasks and ensure that we have as much as critical
    review text available as possible in the packet for Colima.

    In the agenda for the last call is the preliminary plan we
    had prior to Madrid [2]. That plan said:

    -- The original idea was that UB members would read and digest
       the profile ahead of time and prepare small position papers
       by September 1, but we ran out of time to do it this way.
        o Overall shepherd Andrew
        o Evaluate terms against Abstract Model Andrew, Andy
        o Check comments Akira
        o Check documentation Tom
        o Check community buy-in Andrew
        o Check functional requirements Tom

    RESOLVED: Use this as a rough guide.

    Tom: We need to figure out how the tasks can usefully be
    broken out. The review should cover functional requirements
    (how well does it do what it professes, etc.) and other
    criteria, should result in a two- or three-page evaluation.
    Needs other points of view as well, which can be assigned.
    Like having a series of mini-shepherds, with the main shepherd
    pulling it together. Like reading a paper for a conference
    review. We should take a stand on issues of conformance with
    the AM as well as our ideas about what the AP is and should do
    (still fuzzy).

    For example, one area where our document is deficient is
    in documenting terms that are declared somewhere else.
    We need to articulate what our expectations are for
    documentation. We should also come up with changes needed
    for our own process documentation as part of this review.

    ACTION 2006-08-11 (Tom): Send page for Madrid meeting and other
    information around as we pull ourselves together for this task.

    ACTION 2006-08-11 (Andrew): Articulate the questions, then
    names can be assigned in next week's call and deadlines (Note:
    Diane will not be on next week's call).

    ACTION 2006-08-11 (Andrew as shepherd) Mid-Sept. is
    tentative deadline for packet of partial reviews.
    Suggested timetable:

        2006-09-11 Mon UB members complete partial reviews
        2006-09-15 Fri Meeting packet built
        2006-09-30 Sat UB meeting in Colima
