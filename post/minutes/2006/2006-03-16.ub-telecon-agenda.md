HOT ISSUES

-- Finalizing the revised DCSV specifications (Tom, Andrew)

   2006-03-13. Public comment period was held Feb 13 to Mar 15
   [1]. Mikael Nilsson was asked to review the revised specs.
   Mikael's comments, along with a relevant posting from Pete
   on dc-accessibility, are summarized in [2]. These comments
   refer to the version of the DCMI DCSV spec posted for
   public comment on Feb 13, which Tom has now taken into
   account in a further edited version. In the Mar 16 telecon, 
   everyone should please re-read the comments [2] and carefully
   check the corresponding sections in [4] -- specifically, the
   three last paragraphs of the Introduction (starting with "As
   of 2006") and the entire Section 3 ("DCSV syntax encoding
   schemes").

-- Changes to terms in the ELEMENTS1.1 namespace (Tom, Andy, Andrew)
   <a href="http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/term-changes/">http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/term-changes/</a>

   ACTION Andrew 2006-02-23
   -- This document is currently being edited by Andrew. Tom
      suggests that Andrew edit this document in place using
      Subversion to avoid another conversion to/from the Wiki.
   -- Andrew is comparing the draft against what was decided in Madrid:
      <a href="http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/2005-09-10.meeting-notes-excerpts.html">http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/2005-09-10.meeting-notes-excerpts.html</a>
   -- Aside from polishing the text explaining the changes in
      the above, an announcement giving overall context for the
      comment period on dc-general needs to be finalized, see first
      draft at
      <a href="http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/2005-09-21.diane-context-for-changes.txt">http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/2005-09-21.diane-context-for-changes.txt</a>
      (maybe move this draft into the Wiki).

   2006-03-13. Note that the dc:language issue - see
   <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0602&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=601">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0602&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=601</a>.
   is within the scope of this document.
   Is RFC 3066 dated in its approach to 2- and 3-letter language codes?

-- Changes to terms in the DCTERMS namespace (Diane)
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/TermChanges">http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/TermChanges</a>

   2006-03-13. As decided on 2006-02-23, Tom split off any
   changes to terms in the DCTERMS namespace into a separate
   document and placed it in the Wiki. Obviously, this
   document needs to be re-formatted; Tom asks for suggestions
   on how to do this efficiently.

   ACTION 2006-02-23: Diane to consider changes to Date
   refinements and other terms in the DCTERMS namespace.

   2006-03-13. Note:
   -- Added changed "See:" reference for dcterms:URI
   -- Added changed label for dcterms:alternative
   -- Someone should check for spelling consistency:
      organisation/organization (prefer the latter).
   -- dcterms:educationLevel needs a better definition, see
      <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0503&amp;L=DC-USAGE&amp;P=5380">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0503&amp;L=DC-USAGE&amp;P=5380</a>

-- DCMI property domains and ranges (Andy)
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCPropertyDomainsRanges">http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCPropertyDomainsRanges</a>

   2006-03-13. Andy has been working on this and proposes
   that we put it on the agenda for Seattle.

-- Vocabulary of Domain and Range Classes (Andy)
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCPropertyDomainsRanges">http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCPropertyDomainsRanges</a>

   2006-03-13. Andy's DCPropertyDomainsRanges draft (see above)
   uses 30-40 "possible classes" as proposed domains and ranges
   for all DCMI properties. For the domains and ranges to be
   declared machine-readably, these classes would presumably
   need to be defined, approved, given URIs, and maintained.
   Giving them URIs would involve either expanding the DCMI
   Type Vocabulary or creating a new Vocabulary. Creating a
   new Vocabulary would involve revising the DCMI Namespace
   Policy. Giving them definitions would presumably also
   involve deciding on a style for definitions that is
   consistent between the DCMI Type Vocabulary and this new
   Domain-Range Vocabulary:

   -- Current DCMI Type Style: "A service is a system that provides..."
   -- DCMI Type Style, Renaud style: "A resource which is a system..." [2]
   -- Domain-Range Vocabulary style: "The class of all services..." [1]

-- Replicating ELEMENTS1.1 terms in the DCTERMS namespace (Tom)

SIMMERING ISSUES

   ACTION 2006-01-26: Tom to make available for discussion at mid-year meeting
   ACTION 2006-02-09: DCMI Recommendations are taken to be "recommended by DCMI".

       Tom to consider in context of Roadmap - everyone to provide suggestions.
