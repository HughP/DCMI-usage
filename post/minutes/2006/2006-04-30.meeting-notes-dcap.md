Title: Agenda Item #6 -- Review of Application Profiles
              DCMI Usage Board Meeting, 29-30 April 2006, Seattle
Identifier: <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/2006/2006-04-30.meeting-notes-dcap.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/html/2006-04-30.meeting-notes-dcap.html</a>

How can we make it easy for users to prepare application
profiles? These are extant documents that relate to
application profiles:

Points of reference
    DCAP (CEN) documentation guidelines
    <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/2005/09/03/profile-guidelines/">http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/2005/09/03/profile-guidelines/</a>

    Term Decision Tree
    <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/term-decision-tree/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/term-decision-tree/</a>

    DCAP-in-RDF (CEN)
    <a href="http://www.cenorm.be/isss/cwa15248/">http://www.cenorm.be/isss/cwa15248/</a>

    DCMI Abstract Model -&gt; needs Profile Model
    <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/">http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/</a> 

What is an application profile?
    OLD: "list of terms"

    NEW: "Statement of what set of things are being described,
    and a list of terms that going to be used to describe those
    things." If so, then we need an application profile
    for an application profile.

    Is it: 
    -- Rules by which you create a description set for an application?
    -- The makeup of a description set?

    Agreed: Something like `Rules by which a description set is
    "defined"`.

    Description of this DCAP
        dc:creator = Samuel Adams
        dc:title = My application profile
        dc:description
    Model (e.g., entity-relationship model)
    -- Model of Entity 1
       Property 1
       Property 2
       Property 3
    -- Model of Entity 2
       Property 1
       Property 2
       Property 3
    DescriptionUsage
       Description 1
           Occurrence = 1
           Class of described resources = collection (rdf:type, or new term?)
           PropertyUsage
               Uses Property
               Label for this DCAP
               Usage in this DCAP (something like "Usage Comments")

                   Constraint for VESUsage: Occurence
                   Constraint for VESUsage: Condition [text]

                   ...
               Value String Usage
                ...
           PropertyUsage
       Description 2
           Occurrence = 1 or more
           Class of entities = agent
           PropertyUsage
           PropertyUsage

ISSUES
-- Need QualifiedNameforProperty?
-- Need Qualified Name for Syntax Encoding Scheme?
-- Need to serve properties from the property URI -- i.e.,
   translations (Finnish) must come from DCMI namespace?
-- Is an application profile used for instance metadata
   creation?
-- Do property usages have URI`s?
-- How do you say you must use LCSH? In Obligation?
-- Do we need "condition" or does it go in "best practices" documents?
-- Need to model Value String Usage and Obligation.
-- RDF representation of the above
-- Regarding "Local Definition": Definition is sacrosanct --
   if you`re using someone else`s properties the definition
   should not be changed
-- Simple DC defaults to describing resources -- so it does 
   not require models of multiple entities.

DOCUMENTATIONAL VS FORMAL STYLE

-- Do we need two styles (for property usages)? One for humans
   (documentational) and one for machines (formal)? For example,
   should the documentation include, as part of PropertyUsage:

       Source Label {for information only} [do these by reference]
       Source Definition {for information only} [do these by reference]
       Source Comment {for information only} [do these by reference]

DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE
-- How do we maintain a master copy of this AP of an AP?
   RDF/XML should be the master copy. Different scenarios:

   1) NSDL Interface -&gt; RDF/XML -&gt; HTML or XML 
   2) Dctext -&gt; RDF/XML-&gt; HTML or XML
   3) Schema Generation Tool -&gt; RDF/XML-&gt; HTML or XML
   4) Human -&gt; RDF/XML-&gt; HTML or XML

   AGREED: RDF/XML should be complete enough to generate XML
   schemas.

AGREED: A separate list of vocabulary encoding schemes can
be derived from Property Usage, so we do not need a separate
list as part of an application profile.
