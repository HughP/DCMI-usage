HOT ISSUES

-- DCMI property domains and ranges (Andy)
   http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCPropertyDomainsRanges

   2006-03-13. Andy has been working on this and proposes
   that we put it on the agenda for Seattle.

-- Vocabulary of Domain and Range Classes (Andy)
   http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCPropertyDomainsRanges

   2006-03-13. Andy's DCPropertyDomainsRanges draft (see above)
   uses 30-40 "possible classes" as proposed domains and ranges
   for all DCMI properties.  For the domains and ranges to be
   declared machine-readably, these classes would presumably
   need to be defined, approved, given URIs, and maintained.
   Giving them URIs would involve either expanding the DCMI
   Type Vocabulary or creating a new Vocabulary.  Creating a
   new Vocabulary would involve revising the DCMI Namespace
   Policy.  Giving them definitions would presumably also
   involve deciding on a style for definitions that is
   consistent between the DCMI Type Vocabulary and this new
   Domain-Range Vocabulary:

   -- Current DCMI Type Style: "A service is a system that provides..."
   -- DCMI Type Style, Renaud style: "A resource which is a system..." [2]
   -- Domain-Range Vocabulary style: "The class of all services..." [1]

-- Finalizing DCMI Type Vocabulary after the comment period (Stuart)

   2006-03-13.  A public comment
   period was held from 8 Dec to 31 Jan on
   http://dublincore.org/usage/public-comment/2005/12/type-vocabulary-changes/.
   The responses have been summarized in
   http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/public-comment/2006/03/type-vocabulary-comments/.

   -- 2006-03-21.  Tom wonders if there are any documents
      summarizing reasons pro and con.  One possibility from a 
      process point of view would be for Architecture to ask
      UB to take this on, and we could put it on the agenda for
      Seattle.

SIMMERING ISSUES

-- Changes to terms in the ELEMENTS1.1 namespace (Andrew)
   http://stage.dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-01.definitions/term-changes/

   2006-03-16. The background for this issue is that
   documentation of any (and all) changes to the original
   fifteen elements needs to be done on a priority basis
   in order to prepare for a potential NISO review later
   this year.

   ACTION 2006-03-16 Andrew: Wordsmith justifications
   for the proposed changes, also on a per-element basis
   (sections marked "@@@TODO"), with particular attention to
   "content of the resource".

   ACTION 2006-03-16 Andrew: Suggest a comment for
   dc:language along these lines ("Use an encoding
   scheme...") and post to dc-usage for discussion.

-- Diane proposes to use some Seattle meeting time for a very
   quick demo of the NSDL registry

   ACTION 2006-03-16 Diane: Post to dc-usage proposing a demo
   of NSDL registry for Seattle UB meeting - brief description,
   rationale for using meeting time, time required.

-- Review of application profiles - documentation (Tom)
   http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2005/09/profile-review/

   ACTION 2006-01-26: Tom to propose draft "suite" for discussion - which
   parts are "appendices", which are stand-alone, etc.

-- Review of application profiles - profiles
   -- Simple Dublin Core
      ACTION 2006-01-26: Tom to prepare for discussion in Seattle
   -- Collection Description - will not be ready for Seattle - planned for Mexico, see:
      http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/
      http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~lispj/dc-cd/rep200602.html
   -- Agents: will be ready by Mexico
      http://dublincore.org/groups/agents/
   -- Libraries
      http://dublincore.org/groups/libraries/

-- DCMI Documentation Roadmap (Tom)

   ACTION 2006-01-26: Tom to make available for discussion at mid-year meeting
   ACTION 2006-02-09: DCMI Recommendations are taken to be "recommended by DCMI".
       Is this the right message, and does it hamper progress?  Time for a re-think?
       Tom to consider in context of Roadmap - everyone to provide suggestions.

   http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0602&L=dc-general&P=769

-- Wikipedia article on Dublin Core (Diane)
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core 

   ACTION 2006-02-23: Diane to work on Wikipedia article; put on agenda for Seattle.
   UPDATE 2006-03-20: Diane asks us to take a look at what's there now.

-- Revised process document (Stuart and Diane)
   http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/

   2006-03-13. Stuart and Diane to lead discussion in Seattle
   (30 minutes?).  One issue: UB voting procedure.

-- Preparation for UB mid-year meeting, Seattle, Apr 29-30 (Stuart)
   Stuart to report on local arrangements, http://www.watertownseattle.com/

   2006-03-13. Everyone should be purchasing their tickets now
   and confirming your dates of arrival/departure with Stuart.

-- Finalizing the revised DCSV specifications (Tom)

   2006-03-16. After the end of the comment period
   [1], everyone present on the call approves the
   post-comment-period changes made by Tom -- specifically,
   the three last paragraphs of the Introduction (starting
   with "As of 2006") and the entire Section 3 ("DCSV syntax
   encoding schemes") [2].

   Unless Andy or Stuart have further comments, Tom
   will prepare the revised documents for publication and
   announcement with the April 10 Web build.  This time, the
   revised specs will replace both the 2006 comment-period
   version and the 2000 legacy specs as documents with the
   status DCMI Recommendation.

-- Changes to terms in the DCTERMS namespace (Diane)
   http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/TermChanges

   2006-03-13. As decided on 2006-02-23, Tom split off any
   changes to terms in the DCTERMS namespace into a separate
   document and placed it in the Wiki.  Obviously, this
   document needs to be re-formatted; Tom asks for suggestions
   on how to do this efficiently.

   ACTION 2006-02-23: Diane to consider changes to Date
   refinements and other terms in the DCTERMS namespace.

   2006-03-13. Note:
   -- Added changed "See:" reference for dcterms:URI
   -- Added changed label for dcterms:alternative
   -- Someone should check for spelling consistency:
      organisation/organization (prefer the latter).
   -- dcterms:educationLevel needs a better definition, see
      http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0503&L=DC-USAGE&P=5380
