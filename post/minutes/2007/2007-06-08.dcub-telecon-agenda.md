-- SES and VES clarification
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/Encoding-schemes.txt">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/Encoding-schemes.txt</a>

   AGREED: We need a deeper level of description and
   differentiation between VES and SES, including definitions.
   If you have a something already, how do you tell if it is
   VES or SES. If an Encoding Scheme tells you what a value
   string it it's a SES. If Encoding Scheme defines a class
   of values, then it is a VES (e.g., concepts). For example,
   if you develop a list of educational levels, and if you
   define a list of strings, then you're defining an SES.
   If you define a set of concepts and assign URIs to them (as
   best practice), then you're defining a VES. Best practice
   in this scenario is to define a set of concepts with URIs
   rather than a set of strings. Agreed that DC-Education
   is a great test-bed for these concepts. SES is a datatype
   in RDF. VES is like conceptScheme in SKOS, only not limited
   to concepts. For discussion: VES is a set of concepts that,
   once in metadata, allows editors to handle assertion by
   adding things to it. SES is a set of strings.

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Stuart and Joe to write a one-page
   explanation differentiating VES and SES, vet with Pete
   Johnston, and consider revisions to the Term Decision Tree:
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/TermDecisionTree">http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/TermDecisionTree</a>.
   (Note: the difference is basically String vs. Thing.)

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Joe will draft a document discussing
   issues related to principles and purpose of UB decision-making
   (context: decision to define ISO639-2 as a set of codes - see
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DCTermsChangesActions">http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DCTermsChangesActions</a>).

-- Domains and ranges
   Proposal: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2007/02/05/domain-range/">http://dublincore.org/documents/2007/02/05/domain-range/</a>

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Domains and Ranges
   vocabulary to be finalized for Public Comment.
   Barcelona decisions are described in
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DomainsActions">http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DomainsActions</a>

   ACTION 2007-03-17: (for lack of volunteers, by default
   Tom): write a proposal capturing the issue of string,
   unspecified, and thing for the problematic DCTERMS
   properties (title and its subproperties, date and its
   subproperties, and description and its subproperties).
   Taking the following position:
   1. Title and its subproperties as literals [check notes]
   2. Date and its subproperties as literals 
   3. Description and its subproperties as range = rdfs:resource
   Then send this proposal out for public comment. There
   are two audiences for this comment: (1) multiple script
   communities and (2) SW community asking: best practice for
   unspecified ranges. Note that we will use the non-literal
   resource in all cases where the domain of our properities
   is listed as rdfs:resource (in the proposal).

   ACTION 2007-03-18: Diane to define language.

   ACTION 2007-03-18: Andy to add a new class of non-literal
   resource to the wiki, use as domain and range as
   appropriate.

-- Process

   ACTION 2007-04-27: All to comment on Makx's
   proposal for DCMI process simplification -- see April 15
   dc-usage-bc posting.

   ACTION 2007-05-18: Stuart to comment on Process
   simplification proposal with regard to "best practice"
   Application Profiles.
   
   ACTION 2007-05-18: Joe to post augmented Process
   proposal in dc-usage-bc; all to comment.

-- Future of Usage Board

-- Singapore agenda
   -- DCTERMS changes - finalization after July public comment
   -- Domains and ranges - finalization after July public comment?
   -- Application profile review?
   -- Process?

-- Legacy documentation dependent on model

   Revisions to RDF schemas in light of DCAM - a Usage Board issue?

   ACTION 2006-10-01: Tom to replace the Principles
   document at <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/">http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/</a>
   with a page that copies the definitions of elements etc from
   DCAM and includes a short text stating: that the document which
   used to live here has been superseded by the DCAM. Update UB
   page to say we do things in light of the DCAM.
   
   ACTION 2006-10-01: Tom to look through DCMI site
   and note those pages where a reference to the principles
   document needs to be changed to a reference to the DCAM
   as appropriate.

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Tom to write a paragraph
   about placing undeclared legacy DCTERMS classes
   (SubjectScheme, etc, p.64) into historical context -
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/SubjectScheme.txt">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/SubjectScheme.txt</a>
