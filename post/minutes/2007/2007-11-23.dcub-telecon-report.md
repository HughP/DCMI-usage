Goals for this telecon and the next

RESOLVED
-- we finalize "Revisions to DCMI Metadata Terms" today as a UB decision document
-- finalize "Domains and Ranges" in next 2-3 weeks
-- hold back all decision documents until we can release everything together,
   i.e., updated TERMS documentation
-- discuss Review of Application Profiles on telecon before December holidays

ACTION 2007-11-23: Tom to clarify with
Makx the status of Domains and Ranges document
(<a href="http://stage.dublincore.org/documents/2007/12/03/domain-range/">http://stage.dublincore.org/documents/2007/12/03/domain-range/</a>)
- maybe use "Notes for DC in RDF" as model
(<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-rdf-notes/index.shtml">http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-rdf-notes/index.shtml</a>).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Next telecons
-- Alternative slots are
   1. 0600 Seattle / 0900 New York / 1400 London (UTC) / 1500 Berlin / 2300 Tokyo / 0100 Sydney
      Too late for Andrew.
   2. 1300 Seattle / 1600 New York / 2100 London (UTC) / 2200 Berlin / 0600 Tokyo+ / 0800 Sydney+
      Okay Mondays through Thursday, not Friday.

-- A telecon had been scheduled for Dec 14 Fri 14:00 London,
   but we agreed to find a time in slot 2 instead.

ACTION 2007-11-23: Tom to ask Andrew and Akira for availability
12 December, 21:00 London time, for next telecon - as per
<a href="http://www.doodle.ch/fwi26q845ssfc9it">http://www.doodle.ch/fwi26q845ssfc9it</a>. Suggest holding a longer
call (90") in order to finish Domains and Ranges discuss Review
of Profiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made between July public-comment version and December draft decision

ACTION 2007-11-23: Julie to compare the diff of changes between
the July version and December draft of "Revisions to DCMI Metadata
Terms", as posted to to DC-USAGE [1], with the draft meeting notes [2].
[1] <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0711&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=2660">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0711&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=2660</a>
[2] <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/2007/2007-08-26.dcub-meeting-notes.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/2007/2007-08-26.dcub-meeting-notes.html</a>

ACTION 2007-11-23: Tom to put full names at top of meeting notes.
-- DONE - see [MEETING-NOTES]

DECISION: new term dcterms:ISO639-3 approved as worded in
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0711&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=2660">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0711&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=2660</a>
contingent on approval by Akira or Andrew (at least one of them).

ACTION 2007-11-23: Tom to get Akira and Andrew votes for
dcterms:ISO639-3.

AGREED: Tom's paragraph on UB policy for "replacement" terms in 
Introduction to [DCTERMS-CHANGES] is fine.

   <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0711&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=3015">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0711&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;P=3015</a>

AGREED: Tom's paragraph on term type of member terms of DCMI Type 
Vocabulary is fine but needs an additional sentence about the term "member of".

ACTION 2007-11-23: Pete to propose sentence to the effect
that DCAM introduces a property to express the relation
between a resource and vocabulary of which it is a member...
This paragraph (with the additional sentence) will be reused
in some form in the introduction to the DCTERMS document.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Actions arising from Singapore discussion of [DCTERMS-CHANGES]

ACTION 2007-11-23: Joe to own the issue
<a href="http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/IssuesWithCoverage">http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/IssuesWithCoverage</a> for
discussion on a future telecon.

RESOLVED to drop the following action - point 3 to be incorporated
in Joe's note on IssuesWithCoverage:

    ACTION 2007-08-25: (Someone?) to post a list of known issues
    to the UB list (1) for subject -- if read as inclusive, the
    list of examples ("keywords, key phrases, or classification
    codes") is incomplete, (2) classification codes is
    misleading because it misses classification captions (use
    classification expressions instead), (3) 'spatial' and
    'temporal' are "correct" but 'coverage' is too broad --
    it allows for topic and this is in conflict with 'subject'
    [TK] -- but this is an Application Profile issue [TB].

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Review of application profiles (Joe)

ACTION 2007-11-23: Tom post pointers to descriptions of
Singapore Framework for use in preparing December 12 discussion
of Profile review.

AGREED: revised [GRAMMATICAL-PRINCIPLES] are okay but recognize a 
need to mark obsolete documents more clearly on DCMI Web site.
