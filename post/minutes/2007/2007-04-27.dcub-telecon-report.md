DCMI Usage Board - telecon - report

Date: Fri, 2007-04-27 1300 UTC

1. The element Coverage is defined as "The spatial or temporal
    topic of the resource...", then the comment says:

       Spatial topic and spatial applicability may be a
       named place or a location specified by its geographic
       coordinates. Temporal period may be a named period, date,
       or date range.

    The second sentence is clearly meant to parallel the first.
    This obvious mistake (once pointed out) has gone unnoticed
    by UB reviewers and in Public Comment since 2005.

    RESOLVED (on telecon): Change sentence

        Temporal period may be a named period, date, or date range.

    to read:

        Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range.

&gt; As you've probably heard, Tom (and most of Berlin) is without email 
&gt; access, so he asked me to send out a reminder for the call tomorrow 
&gt; and include his apologies for not sending out a revised agenda.
