DOMAINS-RANGES
-- <a href="http://stage.dublincore.org/documents/2008/01/14/domain-range/">http://stage.dublincore.org/documents/2008/01/14/domain-range/</a>

Tom and Pete replaced "[unspecified]" with the implied domain
or implied range of rdfs:Resource so that this is now applied
consistently in the document.  

Explanatory text on the intentions w.r.t. non-literal ranges
has been added.

Pete has updated the class diagrams in
<a href="http://stage.dublincore.org/documents/2008/01/14/domain-range/">http://stage.dublincore.org/documents/2008/01/14/domain-range/</a>.
Tom will check.

ACTION 2007-08-26: Pete and Mikael to investigate the
usefulness of defining a class of 'non-literal' and assess what
the consequences of this would be for machine processability.
(Usage Board should track issues involved in the notion of
a range of 'non-literal'.)

'temporal' are "correct" but 'coverage' is too broad --
it allows for topic and this is in conflict with 'subject'
[TK] -- this is an Application Profile issue [TB].)
