------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage Board telecon - Thu Mar 24, 1400 UTC

Attended: Stuart, Diane, Andrew, Rebecca, Andy, Akira.
Regrets: Traugott

This call was about the Accessibility proposal (see Point 7
excerpted below). We discussed the following decision text,
as proposed by Andy:

        Definition: A statement about the ease with which the
        resource can be accessed, regardless of the technology
        being used.

        Comment: Factors that determine the ease of access
        to the resource include the control of the interface,
        the sensory modality of the resource as presented and
        variations in the expressive form of the information.
        Recommended best practice is to express the value in a
        machine-addressable manner such as the W3C Evaluation
        and Reporting Language (EARL).

        Andy adds: In an ideal world, I would also change
        'machine-addressable' to 'machine-readable'.

In the discussion, the following points were made:

-- The definition for "Accessibility" uses "accessed" but
   does not actually define "access".

-- "Access" is used in other DCMI definitions to mean
   something different. In particular, "accessRights" is
   about who can "access" a resource more in the sense of
   "reach and use".

-- In the W3C world, accessibility is also about
   "intellectual accessibility" -- things like level of
   difficulty and language.

-- The Oxford American dictionary defines "access" with 
   words such as "reached, entered, or used".

-- The definition above represents a broadening of
   the concept Accessibility (as it was originally
   proposed) to include non-digital resources.

-- We agreed that "sensory modality" seems like specialist
   jargon and should be re-worded for understandability.

-- We agreed that there are potentially two ways forward:
   approve a broader term (as above), or focus instead on
   approving a narrower "Web Accessibility" term. We agreed
   that the former (the broader term) is the way to go,
   though a term "Web Accessibility" could in principle be
   proposed subsequently as a refinement of Accessibility.

In sum, we agree that our task is to finalize something very
much like the definition presented above.

ACTION (Tom): To propose alternatives to the word
"accessed" in the definition above. We will try to agree
on such alternative wordings before the next telecon.

ACTION (Stuart): To write a one-page summary of the issues
as we see them - a capsule history of our discussion - and
post it on dc-usage as a one-stop summary of the problem that
we can point people to.

Assuming we can agree on the alternative wording, then:

ACTION (Stuart): To show the definition to Liddy in order
to confirm that the definition does not actually conflict
with their intended uses.

Assuming the answer is "no, it's okay", then we would
hold a final vote to finalize the decision.

7. Element proposal: Accessibility [Stuart]

   -- "Accessibility" Proposal: Agreed to change definition
      to: A description of the qualities of the resource in
      terms of control, display and content that can be used to
      match the needs and preferences of a user. Noted need to
      clarify comment to indicate what is meant by 'control,
      display and content' and to note that recommended best
      practice is to provide a machine-readable statement.

      Background materials - including the proposal - are in
      [1], page 127+. There has been discussion on the list,
      starting at [2]. Stuart summarized this discussion, which
      I have temporarily re-posted at [3].

      ACTION [Stuart] By March 18, agree on a definition
      and comment. Stuart has forwarded to Liddy and re-started
      discussion 

      ACTION [longer-term] We need to clarify the role of the
      proposer as a participant in the Usage Board meeting.
      They can and should serve as a resource for explaining
      the proposal, but it has been suggested that we consider
      asking participants to step out for the discussion.
