DCMI Metadata Terms defines "title" as follows (with no usage comment):

    A name given to the resource.

The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes the following:

    name given to the resource; usually a name by which the resource is formally known. 

    NOTE 1 to entry: If in doubt about what constitutes the title, repeat the
    Title element and include the variants in second and subsequent Title
    iterations.

Proposal: accept or reject?
