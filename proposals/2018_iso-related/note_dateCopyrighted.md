The definition of 
[http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateCopyrighted](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-dateCopyrighted)
currently reads:

    Date of copyright.

with no comment.  The ISO WG proposed to add a comment:
    
    The year to include in a copyright notice is the year of first publication
    of the work. First publication is when the work is made available to the
    public without restriction. This includes selling a book or leaving free
    copies of it in a public place or posting content on your blog. 

It has been noted that the [source cited for this
text](https://www.copyrightlaws.com/copyright-notice-year/) is actually itself
copyrighted, so its re-use here would be problematic.

The proposal, per [discussion on June 27
telecon](../blob/master/minutes/2018/2018-06-27.dcub-telecon-minutes.md) and
the [Github issue](../issues/17#issuecomment-401287232), the proposal is to add
a comment:

    Typically a year.
