See [note_rights.md](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/note_rights.md).

The existing definition and comment for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-rights) read:

    Information about rights held in and over the resource.
    
    Typically, rights information includes a statement about various property
    rights associated with the resource, including intellectual property
    rights.

The ISO WG proposes to add a second comment:
    
    The Rights element may be used for either a textual statement or a URI
    pointing to a rights statement, or a combination, when a brief statement
    and a more lengthy one are available.

The range of dct:rights is [http://purl.org/dc/terms/RightsStatement](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-RightsStatement).
