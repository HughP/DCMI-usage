The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes a usage note for the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualPeriodicity](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-accrualPeriodicity) as follows:

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended best practice is to use a value from the
    [Collection Description Accrual Policy Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/accrual-policy/2007-03-09/).
    Where multiple policies apply, a separate statement should be used for 
    each policy.  

Proposal: accept or reject?
