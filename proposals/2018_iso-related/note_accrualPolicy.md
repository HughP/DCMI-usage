See [note_accrualPolicy.md](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/note_accrualPolicy.md)

Add usage note for property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualPolicy](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-accrualPolicy):

    Recommended best practice is to use a value from the Collection Description
    Accrual Policy Vocabulary [1].  Where multiple policies apply, a separate
    statement should be used for each policy.  

    [1] http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/accrual-policy/

Rationale
* Recommends use of a controlled vocabulary published by DCMI, [Accrual Policy Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/accrual-policy/)

Note
* In ISO 15836-2, this would be published as "NOTE 1 to entry".
* DCMI "owns" the Internet Archive PURL sub-domains for the [Accrual Policy Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/accrual-policy/), http://purl.org/cld/terms and http://purl.org/cld/accpol/
