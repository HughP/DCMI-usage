Change definition of [http://purl.org/dc/terms/available](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-available):

    Date (often a range) that the resource became or will become available.

to read:

    Date the resource became available, or an estimate (often a range) of when
    it will become available.

Rationale

* Proposed by ISO WG
* Clarifies that the date something _became_ available is a single date (and not a range)
* Clarifies that the date something _will become_ available may be an estimate and is often a range
