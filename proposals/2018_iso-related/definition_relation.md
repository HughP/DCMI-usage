See [definition_relation.md](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/definition_relation.md) - see also Issue #27 ('Properties "intended to be used with non-literal values")

DCMI Metadata Terms defines both [http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#elements-relation) and [http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-relation) with the following definition and comment:

    A related resource.

    Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a
    string conforming to a formal identification system.

In addition, DCMI Metadata Terms notes, for [dct:relation](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-relation) - see Issue #27 :

    This term is intended to be used with non-literal values as defined in the
    DCMI Abstract Model.  As of December 2007, the DCMI Usage Board is seeking
    a way to express this intention with a formal range declaration.

The ISO WG proposes:

    A reference to a related resource.

    Best practice is to identify the related resource by means of an URI or a
    string conforming to a formal identification system.

Note:
* In ISO 15836-2, the notes would be "NOTE x to entry:".
* Definition was originally proposed by ISO WG without initial uppercase and full stop.
