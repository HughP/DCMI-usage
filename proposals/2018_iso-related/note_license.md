In DCMIMT, the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/license](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-license) has as a range of [http://purl.org/dc/terms/LicenseDocument](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument).

The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes the following note for dct:license:

    Note 1 to entry: The License element should contain either the name of the
    license or a URI pointing to a license document.

    EXAMPLES:     http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en
                  http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
                  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode

Discussion:
* "the name of the license" would be a literal
* classes do not "contain" URIs
* an instance of the class may be identified by a URI
