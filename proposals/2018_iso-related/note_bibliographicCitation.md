See [note_bibliographicCitation.md](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/note_bibliographicCitation.md).

Add comment for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-bibliographicCitation):

    Best practice is to include sufficient bibliographic detail to identify the
    cited resource unambiguously.

    EXAMPLE    Library and Information Science Research 22(3), 311-338

Note:
* The range of bibliographicCitation is an object, http://purl.org/dc/terms/BibliographicResource .
* The first comment would appear in ISO 15836-2 as "NOTE 1 to entry:".
