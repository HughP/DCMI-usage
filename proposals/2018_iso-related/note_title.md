Add a comment for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/title](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-title):

    Typically, a Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known.

    If in doubt about what constitutes the title, repeat the Title element and
    include the variants in second and subsequent Title iterations.

Note:
* These would appear in ISO 15836-2 as "NOTE 1 to entry:" and "NOTE 2 to entry:".

Note that the ISO WG actually suggests changing the definition to read:

    A name given to the resource; usually a name by which the resource is
    formally known. 

Older Usage Board members may vaguely recall discussions of this very point in
the early 2000s involving somewhat inconclusive discussions about what might be
considered "formal".  Before 2006, the comment for Title read:

    Typically, a Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known.

Exercising his judgement as Chair, Tom has edited this proposal into one for
reinstating the earlier comment.
