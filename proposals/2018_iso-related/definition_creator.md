See [definition_creator.md](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/definition_creator.md).

DCMI Metadata Terms currently defines [http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-creator) with the following definition and 
usage comment:

    An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.

    Examples of a Creator include a person, an organization, or a service.

The ISO WG proposes folding the content of the comment into the definition:
    
    An entity, such as a person, organization, or service, primarily
    responsible for making the resource.

Note:
* This would be expressed in "ISO style" (lowercase, etc).
* Original proposal from the ISO WG read:
    
    entity (for instance, a person, an organization or a service) primarily
    responsible for making the resource
