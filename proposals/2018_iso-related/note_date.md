DCMI Metadata Terms provides the following usage comment for the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/date](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-date):

    Date may be used to express temporal information at any level of
    granularity. Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme, such
    as the W3CDTF profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF].

The draft ISO 15836-2 adds the following usage notes for "date", plus an example:

    NOTE 1 to entry: Date may be used to express temporal information at any
    level of granularity. Best practice is to express the date, time or period
    according to the YYYY-MM-DD format specified in ISO 8601. 

    Note 2 to entry: If the full date is unknown, month and year (YYYY-MM) or
    just year (YYYY) may be used.

    Note 3 to entry: Date ranges may be specified using ISO 8601 period of time
    specification in which start and end dates are separated by a “/” (slash)
    character. Either the start or end date may be missing. 

    EXAMPLES: 2018
              2016-03-04
              1968/2015
              2006/
