** PLEASE VOTE WITH THUMBS-UP/DOWN **

See [note_accrualX.md](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/note_accrualX.md).

Note: 
* Supersedes closed issues #11, #12, #13.
* Revised comment avoids "recommending" a particular vocabulary as per 
  [Makx's comment](https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/12#issuecomment-394728694).
* Drops ISO-WG-proposed suggestion that "Where multiple policies apply, a separate
  statement should be used for each policy."

Issues:
* Do we want to recommend use of a controlled vocabulary (as for many other existing properties)?
* Do we want to call out these particular vocabularies, published by DCMI?

    Recommended practice is to use a value from a controlled vocabulary such as
    the Dublin Core Collection Description Accrual Method Vocabulary [1].
