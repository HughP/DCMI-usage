Add comment for property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualPeriodicity](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-accrualPeriodicity):

    Recommended best practice is to use a value from the Dublin Core Collection
    Description Frequency Vocabulary [1].
    
    [1] http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/frequency/

Rationale
* Recommends use of a controlled vocabulary published by DCMI, [Frequency Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/frequency/)

Note
* In ISO 15836-2, this would be published as "NOTE 1 to entry".
* DCMI "owns" the Internet Archive PURL sub-domains for the [Frequency Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/frequency/), http://purl.org/cld/terms and http://purl.org/cld/accmeth/
