See [range_creator](../blob/master/proposals/2018_iso-related/range_creator.md).

Add comments for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-creator):

    Typically the name of the Creator should be used to indicate the entity.

    Creators should be listed separately, preferably in the same order that
    they appear in the publication. Personal names should be listed surname or
    family name first, followed by forename or given name.  When in doubt, give
    the name as it appears, and do not invert.

    EXAMPLES:  Shakespeare, William
               Hubble telescope.
               Verohallinto. Suomi

Note: 
* "creator" has a range of [dct:Agent](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-Agent).
* These would be "NOTE 1 to entry:" and "NOTE 2 to entry:".
* The property [dc:creator](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#elements-creator) already 
  has the _almost_ identical comment (note "a" changed to "the"):

    Typically the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.
