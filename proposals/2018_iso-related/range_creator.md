DCMI Metadata Terms defines the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-creator) with the following definition and 
usage comment:

    An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.

    Examples of a Creator include a person, an organization, or a service.

The draft ISO 15836-2 defines "creator", with usage comments and examples, as
follows:
    
    entity (for instance, a person, an organization or a service) primarily
    responsible for making the resource

    Note 1 to entry: Typically the name of the Creator should be used to
    indicate the entity.

    Note 2 to entry: Creators should be listed separately, preferably in the
    same order that they appear in the publication. Personal names should be
    listed surname or family name first, followed by forename or given name.
    When in doubt, give the name as it appears, and do not invert.

    EXAMPLES:  Shakespeare, William
               Hubble telescope.
               Verohallinto. Suomi

Problem: "creator" has a range of "Agent" (a resource).
