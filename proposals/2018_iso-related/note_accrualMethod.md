Add comment for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualMethod](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-accrualMethod):

    Recommended best practice is to use a value from the Dublin Core Collection
    Description Accrual Method Vocabulary [1].  Where multiple methods apply, a
    separate statement should be used for each method.

Rationale
* Recommends use of a controlled vocabulary published by DCMI.

Note
* In ISO 15836-2, this would be published as "NOTE 1 to entry".
