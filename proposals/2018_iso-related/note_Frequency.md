ISO 15836-2 proposes, as a usage note for the class [http://purl.org/dc/terms/Frequency](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-Frequency) as follows:

    NOTE 1 to entry: For instance, publication frequency of a serial.

Note that in DCMIMT, dct:Frequency is used only as the range of the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualPeriodicity](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-accrualPeriodicity).

Proposal: accept or reject?
