The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes to add the following usage comment for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/rightsHolder](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-rightsHolder):

    NOTE 1 to entry: Recommended best practice is to use the name and/or URI of
    the rights holder to indicate the entity

Problem: the range of rightsHolder is [http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-Agent).
