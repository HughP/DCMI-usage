The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes a usage note for "bibliographicCitation":

    NOTE 1 to entry: Best practice is to include sufficient bibliographic
    detail to identify the cited resource unambiguously.

    EXAMPLE    Library and Information Science Research 22(3), 311-338

Proposal: accept or reject?
