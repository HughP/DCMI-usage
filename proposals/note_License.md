In the draft ISO 15836-2, the class [http://purl.org/dc/terms/LicenseDocument](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument) has a comment which is conceptually wrong:

    Note 1 to entry: The LicenseDocument element should contain a URI pointing to a license document.

Proposal: remove the comment.
