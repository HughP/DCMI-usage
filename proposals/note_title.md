DCMI Metadata Terms defines the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/title](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-title) as follows:

    A name given to the resource.

The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes the following definition and note:

    name given to the resource; usually a name by which the resource is formally known. 

    NOTE 1 to entry: If in doubt about what constitutes the title, repeat the
    Title element and include the variants in second and subsequent Title
    iterations.

Proposal: accept or reject?
