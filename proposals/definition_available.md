DCMI Metadata Terms defines [http://purl.org/dc/terms/available](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-available) as follows:

    Date (often a range) that the resource became or will become available.

The draft ISO 15836-2 defines "available" as follows:

    date the resource became available, or an estimate (often a range) of when
    it will become available

The proposal aims at clarifying that:
1.  the date something _became_ available is a single date (and not a range), and 
2.  the date something _will become_ available may be an estimate and is often a range.

Proposal: accept or reject?
