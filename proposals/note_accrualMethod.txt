The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes a usage note for "accrual method":

    NOTE 1 to entry: Recommended best practice is to use a value from the
    Collection Description Accrual Method Vocabulary [*].  Where multiple
    methods apply, a separate statement should be used for each method. 

    [*] http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/accrual-method/
        
Proposal: accept or reject?
