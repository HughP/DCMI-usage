The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes a usage note for "accrual periodicity":

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended best practice is to use a value from the
    Collection Description Accrual Policy Vocabulary [*]. Where multiple
    policies apply, a separate statement should be used for each policy.  

    [*] http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/accrual-policy/

Proposal: accept or reject?
