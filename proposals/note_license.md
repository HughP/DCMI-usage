In DCMIMT, the property [http://purl.org/dc/terms/license](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-license) has as a range of [http://purl.org/dc/terms/LicenseDocument](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument).

The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes the following note for dct:license:

    Note 1 to entry: The LicenseDocument element should contain a URI pointing to a license document.

Discussion:
* the class dct:LicenseDocument is not an element (or property)
* classes do not "contain" URIs
* an instance of the class may be identified by a URI

Options:
* reject the note
* reword
