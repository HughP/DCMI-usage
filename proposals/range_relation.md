DCMI Metadata Terms defines "relation"

    A related resource

DCMI Metadata Terms notes, for "relation":

    This term is intended to be used with non-literal values as defined in the
    DCMI Abstract Model.  As of December 2007, the DCMI Usage Board is seeking
    a way to express this intention with a formal range declaration.

The draft ISO 15836-2 proposes a definition and usage notes as follows:

    reference to a related resource

    NOTE 1 to entry: Best practice is to identify the related resource by means
    of an URI or a string conforming to a formal identification system.

    NOTE 2 to entry: Relationships may be expressed reciprocally (if the
    resources on both ends of the relationship are being described) or in one
    direction only, even when there is a refinement available to allow
    reciprocity. If text strings are used instead of identifying numbers, the
    reference should be appropriately specific. For instance, a formal
    bibliographic citation might be used to point users to a particular
    resource.

    NOTE 3 to entry: Dublin Core Usage guide  contains more information about
    various relations and how they should be encoded 

    EXAMPLE  Title=”My Fair Lady (movie)”
             Title=”Pygmalion (play)”
             Relation described is IsBasedOn
