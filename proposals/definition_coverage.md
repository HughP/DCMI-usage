DCMIMT currently defines [http://purl.org/dc/terms/coverage](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-coverage) as follows:

    "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial
    applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the
    resource is relevant."

The ISO 15836 definition currently reads (note the absences of "the"): 
    
        "spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial applicability of
        the resource, or jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant"

Proposal: No change to ISO 15836. DCMIMT should edited to lose some articles while retaining the initial "The":

       "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial applicability of
       the resource, or jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant."
