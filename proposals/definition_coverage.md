Definition of "coverage"

    The DCMIMT definition currently reads: 
    
        "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial
        applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the
        resource is relevant."

    The ISO 15836 definition currently reads (note the absences of "the"): 
    
        "spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial applicability of
        the resource, or jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant"

Proposal: No change to ISO 15836. DCMIMT should eventually be edited to read,
losing some articles (but retaining the initial "The"):

       "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial applicability of
       the resource, or jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant."

Usage comment
    
    The DCMIMT comment refers to "the Thesaurus", and the ISO 15836 note refers 
    to "the Getty Thesaurus".

Proposal: Edit DCMIMT to read "the Getty Thesaurus".
