Dear Readers:

Here is the tally of votes with the following notes:

\* The typographical error in 12 & 14 has been corrected.

\* The following did not receive a majority of positive votes [number of   
votes for/against shown in brackets]:

15 & 16 Continues [5/8]& Definition [5/8]   
17 & 18 Is ContinuedBy [5/8] & Definition [5/8]   
23 & 24 OtherFormat [3/10] & Definition [3/10]

\* While receiving a majority of votes, the following do not seem to   
represent a consensus:

22 Definition of HasFormat [7/6]   
29 & 30 IsBasedOn [7/6] & Definition [7/6]   
31 & 32 IsBasisFor [7/6] & Definition [7/6]

Given that # 19, IsFormatOf [10/3], and # 21, HasFormat [9/3] received   
majority positive votes, it would seem that we must modify the definition   
[7/6] of HasFormat.

IsBasedOn and IsBasisFor seem to need more discussion. Conflict with Source   
was noted.

Comments or suggestions?
