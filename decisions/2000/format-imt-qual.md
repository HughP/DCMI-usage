- working group defining the qualifier   
DC-Format

- which DC element is being qualified?   
Format

- proposed name of the qualifier   
IMT

- definition of the qualifier   
The Internet MIME Type of the resource.

- does the qualifier refine the semantics of the element (y/n)   
no

- is the qualifier a controlled vocabulary (enumerated list of values)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;maintained by the DCMI? (y/n)   
no

- is the qualifier a controlled vocabulary (enumerated list of values)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;maintained by another organization? (y/n). If yes, please supply a URL   
&nbsp;&nbsp;pointing to further information about the vocabulary (if available).   
yes   
 [http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types](http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types)

- is the qualifier a formal encoding format (y/n). If yes, please supply   
&nbsp;&nbsp;a URL pointing to further information about the format (if available).   
no

- justification/explanation (optional but recommended)   
This value qualifier for Format allows the metadata creator to indicate   
the Internet MIME Type of the resource. This is the 'standard' mechanism   
for indicating the media-type of a digital resource on the Internet.   
Examples include:   
DC.Format (Scheme=IMT) = text/html

- identify potential overlap/conflicts with other qualifiers if applicable   
&nbsp;&nbsp;(optional)   
MIME types and sub-types mix up modality (text) and encoding (html) in a   
way that is undesirable and confusing with respect to the DC Type element.   
However, given the widespread use of MIME types for Internet resources,   
the WG sees little alternative than to recommend their use in the Format   
element.   
Recommended best practice for digital resources is to use the IMT   
value qualifier in conjunction with the Medium element qualifier for   
Format.
