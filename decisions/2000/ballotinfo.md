      <h4>Principals of Qualification </h4>
      <p>This document presents the results of a process to develop exemplary 
      qualifiers for the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES). The 
      qualifiers listed here were identified in element-specific working groups 
      of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and found by a DCMI Usage 
      Committee to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the 
      qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements. The element-specific 
      working groups sought to identify qualifiers that are likely to be of 
      widespread use. In determining the makeup of these qualifiers, preference 
      was given to vocabularies, notations, and terms for which the reference 
      documentation is already being maintained by established institutions. 
</p>
      <p>Inevitably, there will be situations where an agent or client will 
      encounter DCMES descriptions that use unfamiliar qualifiers developed by 
      implementors for specialized local needs (eg, for describing maps, moving 
      images, or museum objects). The useful interpretation of such a DCMES 
      description will depend on the ability to ignore the unknown qualifiers 
      and fall back on the broader meaning of the element in its unqualified 
      form. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, 
      also known as the Dumb-Down Principle, is that a client should be able to 
      ignore any qualifier and use the description as if it were unqualified. 
      While this may result in some loss of specific meaning, the remaining 
      element value (minus the qualifier) must continue to be generally correct. 
      </p>
      <p>As of February 2000, the DCMI recognizes two broad classes of 
      qualifiers: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<b>Encoding Scheme.</b> These qualifiers are pointers to schemes 
        that aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes 
        include controlled vocabularies and formal notations. A value expressed 
        using an Encoding Scheme will thus be a token selected from a vocabulary 
        (e.g., a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) 
        or a string formatted in accordance with a notation (e.g., "2000-01-01" 
        as the standard expression of a date). If a Value Encoding Scheme is not 
        understood by a client or agent (eg, in an indexing application), this 
        should not render the value useless. The definitive description of a 
        scheme must be clearly identified and available for public use. 
        </li>
<li>
<b>Element Refinement.</b> These qualifiers make an element's 
        meaning more specific without extending its meaning. A refined element 
        shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more 
        restricted scope. A client that does not understand a specific element 
        refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the 
        qualified value as if it were a value of the unqualified (broader) 
        element. The definitions of element refinement terms must be clear and 
        publicly available. </li>
</ul>
      <p>All of the qualifiers listed in this document fall clearly into one of 
      these two categories. Additional categorization for these qualifiers will 
      evolve over time and with implementation experience. Proposed qualifiers 
      which appeared to the Usage Committee to fall outside of these categories, 
      or which fell short in some other respect (e.g., clarity of definition), 
      will become the focus of further discussion and be reconsidered for 
      approval in the future. </p>
      <p>The qualifiers listed here do not constitute a closed set, designed to 
      meet all of the descriptive needs of implementors. Rather, they seed a 
      larger database of qualifiers that will evolve as qualifiers are developed 
      by various communities and submitted to the Usage Committee for review. 
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, implementors may deploy these qualifiers with 
      confidence that they conform to the Dumb-Down Principle, and they may take 
      these qualifiers as examples to guide their own development of 
      `principled' qualifiers for Dublin Core metadata elements. </p>
      <p>For each data element in the ballot, the following information is 
      provided: 
      </p>
<ul>
        <li>
<b>Label: </b>The human-readable label assigned to the data element. 

        </li>
<li>
<b>Name: </b>The machine-understandable token assigned to the data 
        element (the concatenation of the 'Name' to the 'NameSpace' provides a 
        URI uniquely identifying the data element). 
        </li>
<li>
<b>Definition: </b>A statement that clearly represents the concept 
        and essential nature of the data element. 
        </li>
<li>
<b>Comment: </b>Addition information associate with the data 
        element. 
        </li>
<li>
<b>See Also: </b>A link to more information about the data element 
        (if available). </li>
</ul>
