Description: Documentation of the first set of qualifiers approved by 
                     the DCMI Usage Committee [1].

<br>
From December 1999 through July 2000, the DCMI Usage Committee voted on and 
finalized the first set of "Dublin Core Qualifiers". These were published 
as a DCMI Recommendation on 11 July 2000 [2].
<br>
The voting results and reviewer comments are summarized on seven Web pages 
[3-9]. Fuller documentation of the vote, such as the original proposals and 
information about the online voting system used (which was developed at SZTAKI 
in Budapest, Hungary), can be found through an archived copy of the original 
start page [10].
