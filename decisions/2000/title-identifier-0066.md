Dear All,

due to complete destruction of my hard disk over two weeks ago, I have had   
problems keeping up with the email and deadlines imposed on the working   
groups. Tomorrow, I will (presumably) have access to my original data,   
including the recommendations of the DC.Title working Group which were to   
go up on the web after DC 7. This information was sent to the DC.title   
working group members after the DC 7 and to the dc-general list. I have now   
received several more responses and will send the final review page to Beth   
Marsh by Thursday (presuming I get to my former data).

The basic gist of the review procedure was that DC.Title.Alternative was   
the only approved qualifier for the DC Element set. Audience and release   
were relegated to discussion in the Subject/Description and DC.Education   
Working Groups.

I apologize for the delays, but beg for understanding that this computer   
damage really made work difficult for me and I am still picking up the   
pieces of work undone due to this situation. My institute didn't even have   
a substitute machine to use while the computer is being repaired, and   
picking up my emails with my laptop from home proved to bring new problems   
to solve (which hopefully are also now over).

Thanks, Tom, for your call - wishing you all a blessed Christmas or other   
holiday at the year's end and a good start for the New Year (with as few   
computer problems as is possible!)

Diann
