->  These two constructs (DCAM-2, RDF-Turtle-2) are
->  inconsistent with the intent that the property not be used
->  with literal values.  One of the primary motivations for
    creating these three dcterms:* properties - apart from
    the "why can't we just use one namespace?" issue - was
    to try to achieve a consistent usage of these properties,
    i.e. to declare/describe the properties in such a way that
    implementers would use the forms DCAM-1 and RDF-Turtle-1,
    and the forms DCAM-2 and RDF-Turtle-2 were not used.

->  But in the RDF case, to an RDF implementer, the phrase
->  "the name ...  should be used to indicate the entity"
->  strongly implies strongly implies that the property be
->  used with a literal object, which is not its intended use.
