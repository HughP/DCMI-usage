Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
                  considered at the Usage Board meeting of May 2002
                  in Bath. This document is pointed to from
                  the official list of Usage Board Decisions [1].

Decision: Accept

Reason: The new wording for the 'mediator' comment proposed 
here eliminates specific references to education and training, making
the term dct:mediator more generic for cross-domain usage. The
amended language generalizes the refinement without loss of
meaning to the education community. If a tighter link to the
education domain were deemed necessary, such a link could be
done in an education application profile.

    Label: Mediator
    Definition: A class of entity that mediates access to the
                   resource and for whom the resource is intended or useful.
    Comment: The audiences for a resource are of two basic classes: (1) an 
                   ultimate beneficiary of the resource, and (2) frequently, an 
                   entity that mediates access to the resource. The mediator 
                   element refinement represents the second of these two classes.
