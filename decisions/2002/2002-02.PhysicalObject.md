Title: Decision on proposal for new term "PhysicalObject"
Shepherd: Rebecca Guenther
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.PhysicalObject.shtml">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.PhysicalObject.shtml</a>
Date: 2002-07-13
Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
                  considered at the Usage Board meeting of May 2002
                  in Bath. This document is pointed to from
                  the official list of Usage Board Decisions [1].

Text of proposal: <a href="/usage/meetings/2002/05/type-physobj.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/type-physobj.html</a>
Discussion: <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0204&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;O=A&amp;P=10679">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0204&amp;L=dc-usage&amp;O=A&amp;P=10679</a>

Decision: Accept with status "recommended" (with modified definition)

Reason: It was unclear to the Usage Board whether 'wheat'
is a physical object or a concept, and also unclear whether
live animals were meant to be included or not. The Board
removed ', wheat' from the definition as proposed, and changed
'non-human' to 'inanimate' -- i.e., trees and lions are out
of scope, while mummies and stuffed animals are in.
