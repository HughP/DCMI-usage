Title: A change of wording in the comment for the term "mediator"
Shepherd: Stuart Sutton
Date: 2002-07-13
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2002/2002-01.mediator.shtml">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2002/2002-01.mediator.shtml</a>
Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
               considered at the Usage Board meeting of May 2002
               in Bath. This particular decision is part of a cluster of
               decisions documented at
               <a href="/usage/decisions/#Decision-2002-02">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/#Decision-2002-02</a>.

Comment: If the status <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/mediator">http://purl.org/dc/terms/mediator</a> is
changed from Domain-Specific to Recommended, this implies
rewording of the definition or comment to ensure that the term
is applicable more broadly. The new wording proposed here
eliminates specific references to education and training, making
the term dct:mediator more generic for cross-domain usage. The
amended language generalizes the refinement without loss of
meaning to the education community. If a tighter link to the
education domain were deemed necessary, such a link could be
done in an application profile.

    Comment: The audience for a resource in the education/training
                   domain are of two basic classes: (1) an ultimate beneficiary of
                   the resource (usually a student or trainee), and (2) frequently,
                   an entity that mediates access to the resource (usually a
                   teacher or trainer). The mediator element refinement represents
                   the second of these two classes.
