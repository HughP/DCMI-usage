Title: Decision on proposal for new term "accepted"
Shepherd: Rebecca Guenther
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.accepted.shtml">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.accepted.shtml</a>
Date: 2002-07-13
Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
                  considered at the Usage Board meeting of May 2002
                  in Bath. This document is pointed to from
                  the official list of Usage Board Decisions [1].

Text of proposal: <a href="/usage/meetings/2002/05/accepted-date_prop.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/accepted-date_prop.html</a>

Decision: Accept with status "conforming"

Reason: 'accepted' is administrative in nature and thus not
for cross-domain resource discovery. It conforms to principles
of element refinement, hence the status "conforming".

Comment: The Usage Board questioned a possible
overlap between this Element Refinement and a Refinement
proposed by in a DC-Government proposal: Date "acquired" (see
<a href="/groups/government/DCMI-gov-proposal-2002-04-18.html">http://www.dublincore.org/groups/government/DCMI-gov-proposal-2002-04-18.html</a>).
As no formal decision has been made about about the DC-Gov
element, the issue will be considered at a later date.
