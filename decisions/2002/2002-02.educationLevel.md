Title: Decision on proposal for new term "educationLevel"
Shepherd: Diane Hillmann
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.educationLevel.shtml">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.educationLevel.shtml</a>
Date: 2002-07-13
Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
                  considered at the Usage Board meeting of May 2002
                  in Bath. This document is pointed to from
                  the official list of Usage Board Decisions [1].

Text of proposal: <a href="/groups/education/Audience-Level-Proposal.shtml">http://dublincore.org/groups/education/Audience-Level-Proposal.shtml</a>

Decision: Accept (with modified definition and elimination of 
the comment)

Reason: The proposed element refinement is not intended to say
anything about the 'mediator' (the only existing refinement of
dcterms:audience). The proposed name audienceLevel was changed 
to educationLevel to reflect the narrower context of the proposed
refinement. The proposed comment was deleted as unnecessary.
