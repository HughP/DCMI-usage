Title: Decision on proposal for new term "version"
Shepherd: Rebecca Guenther
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.version.shtml">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2002/2002-02.version.shtml</a>

Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
                  considered at the Usage Board meeting of May 2002
                  in Bath. This document is pointed to from
                  the official list of Usage Board Decisions [1].

Text of proposal:
<a href="/usage/meetings/2002/05/description-version_prop.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/description-version_prop.html</a>

Decision: The Usage Board recommends using the element
"edition" from the MODS namespace, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/mods/">http://www.loc.gov/mods/</a>.

Reason: Since the element is defined in another namespace
with the same semantics as proposed, this will satisfy the
needs for DC-Libraries Application Profile. The element
"edition" in MODS complies in a general way with Dublin
Core principles and does not conflict with other DC terms.
This decision is supported by the decision tree condition
#2 in Section 5.5 of the Usage Board Process (see
<a href="/usage/documents/2002/03/20/process/">http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/2002/03/20/process/</a>).
