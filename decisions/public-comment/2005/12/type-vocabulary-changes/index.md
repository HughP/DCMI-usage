Title: Public Comment on Changes to the DCMI Type Vocabulary
Identifier: <a href="/usage/public-comment/2005/12/type-vocabulary-changes/">http://dublincore.org/usage/public-comment/2005/12/type-vocabulary-changes/</a>
Date: 2005-12-08

The DCMI Usage Board proposes the attached changes (see
below) to definitions and comments of terms of the DCMI Type
Vocabulary [1,2]. The changes, which were discussed at recent
meetings of the Usage Board [3,4], are essentially editorial
in nature:

    1) Definitions were wordsmithed for grammatical correctness
       and stylistic consistency.

    2) As they were originally written, the definitions of
       DCMI Type terms included information about expected uses
       of the term -- information which, for other types of
       DCMI terms, is typically provided in a separate Comment.
       For stylistic consistency, therefore, parts of the
       current Definitions were split off into Comments.

It is worth noting that the Usage Board did not undertake any
more fundamental discussion of the typology offered in the DCMI
Type Vocabulary. As clarified in a posting to DC-GENERAL in
December 2003 [5], the Usage Board does not intend to expand
or otherwise clarify the existing vocabulary; rather, it
"prefers to focus on interoperability between the DCMI Type
Vocabulary and other, more granular vocabularies created and
maintained by communities of interest for specialized uses."

Public comment is therefore solicited primarily not on the
concepts underlying the DCMI Types, but on the potential impact
of the these editorial changes on existing interpretations
and implementations.

Public Comment will be open from 12 December 2005 to 31
January 2006.
