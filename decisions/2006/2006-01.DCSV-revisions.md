Title: Revision of DCSV specifications
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2006/2006-01.DCSV-revisions.shtml">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2006/2006-01.DCSV-revisions.shtml</a>
Created: 2006-02-08

Following the approval of the DCMI Abstract Model in March
2005 as a DCMI Recommendation, the Usage Board undertook a
revision of the legacy DCMI Recommendations -- DCMI DCSV [1],
DCMI Period [2], DCMI Point [3], and DCMI Box [4] to bring
their language in line with that of the DCMI Abstract Model
[5].

Revised specifications were first made available for
public comment as DCMI Proposed Recommendations in July 2005
[6,7,8,9], then further revised as replacements for the legacy
DCMI Recommendations. The latest versions of these documents
can be found at [10,11,12,13].

The main changes were:
-- Removed provisional XML examples and encodings. 
-- Removed unused references.
-- Removed unused terms from glossary.
-- Terminology, wordings and document titles were changed
   to conform to the language of the DCMI Abstract Model
   (see below).

The main changes in terminology and wording were:
-- Use of the term "value" was made consistent with Abstract 
   Model (e.g., with references to a "value string").
-- The term 'structured value' was replaced with 'structured
   value string'.
-- The terms 'label' and 'value', used to describe the parts
   of the components of structured values, were replaced
   with new terms 'componentLabel' and 'componentValue'
   respectively.

As of 1995, the DCMI Abstract Model supports the
representation of complex structures, such as those encoded in
DCSV-syntax-based encoding schemes, as "related descriptions".
The DCMI Usage Board encourages implementers to consider the
longer-term consequences for interoperability of packaging
structured information in parsable DCSV-encoded string
values as opposed to conveying that information in related
descriptions using other syntax encodings.
