Title: Changes to the DCMI Type Vocabulary
Identifier: <a href="/usage/decisions/2006/2006-02.dcmitype-changes.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2006/2006-02.dcmitype-changes.shtml</a>

Description: This decision text refers to 
              <a href="/usage/decisions/#Decision-2006-02">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/#Decision-2006-02</a>.

In 2005, the DCMI Usage Board undertook a review of the
Definitions and Comments of terms in the DCMI Type Vocabulary
[1,2]. Potential changes were discussed at meetings of the
Usage Board in May 2005 [3] and September 2005 [4]. A public
comment period on proposed changes was held from 8 December
to 31 January 2006 [5,6]. Decisions on these changes were
taken at a Usage Board meeting on 30 April 2006 [7] and are
recorded in this decision document.

The proposed changes were essentially editorial in nature:

    1) Definitions were wordsmithed for grammatical correctness
       and stylistic consistency.

    2) As originally written, the Definitions of
       DCMI Type terms included information about expected
       uses of the term -- information which, for other types
       of DCMI terms, is typically provided in a separate
       Comment. For stylistic consistency, therefore, parts
       of the Definitions were split off into Comments.

The Usage Board did not undertake a fundamental review of
the typology (ontology) offered in the DCMI Type Vocabulary.
As explained in a posting to DC-GENERAL in December 2003 [8],
the Usage Board does not intend to expand or otherwise improve
the existing vocabulary; rather, it prefers that future efforts
"focus on interoperability between the DCMI Type Vocabulary
and other, more granular vocabularies created and maintained
by communities of interest for specialized uses."

Public comment was therefore solicited primarily not on the
concepts underlying the DCMI Types, but on the potential impact
of the proposed editorial changes on existing interpretations
and implementations (see summary of comments in [6]).

Finalizing the editorial changes after the public comment
involved a discussion of the style used for definitions of
the Type Vocabulary. Three styles were considered:

   1. The legacy style for the DCMI Type Vocabulary [9], e.g.:

         Collection: An aggregation of items.

   2. A style proposed during the comment period by Gregory
      Renaud [6], e.g.:

         Collection: A resource which is an aggregation of items.

   3. The style used by Andy Powell in a draft Domain-Range 
      Vocabulary [10,11]:

         Collection: The class of all aggregations of items.

At its face-to-face meeting of 30 April 2006, the DCMI Usage
Board reaffirmed the legacy style (style number 1) and approved
the definition and comment texts which appear below.

    Official&gt; Definition: A collection is an aggregation of items. The term
    Official&gt; collection means that the resource is
    Official&gt; described as a group; its parts may be
    Official&gt; separately described and navigated.

    Proposed&gt; Definition: An aggregation of items.
    Proposed&gt; Comment: The term Collection means that the resource
    Proposed&gt; is described as a group; its parts may also
    Proposed&gt; be separately described and navigated.

    Approved: <a href="/usage/decisions/#Decision-2006-02">http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/#Decision-2006-02</a>

        Definition: An aggregation of resources.

        Comment: A collection is described as a group; its parts
        may also be separately described.

    Note justifying the change: The original definition
    referred to "an aggregation of items". However,
    the Usage Board wished to avoid confusion with the
    more specific notion of "item" defined in the widely
    discussed "Functional Requirements for Bibliographic
    Records" as "a single exemplar of a manifestation"
    (see http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr.pdf).

    Official&gt; tea-party, conflagration.
