Title: Decision on proposal for dcterms:instructionalMethod
Shepherd: Akira Miyazawa
Identifier: http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2005/2005-02.instructionalMethod.html
Date: 2005-06-13
Description: The decision documented here refers to a proposal
               considered at the Usage Board meeting of October 2004
               in Shanghai. 

Proposal text: <a href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/8-28-04/">
http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/8-28-04/</a> and
<a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/10/ISSUES/terms-education/">
http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/10/ISSUES/terms-education/</a>

Decision: Accept (with modified Definition and Comment)

Discussion:

The phrase "designed to support" was introduced in the definition
to clarify the proposed element is used only for the resources
where the intention of the usage is explicit or implied.

Community support for this element was questioned, and following
explanation was accepted:

Being able to capture metadata statements about the learning
processes and techniques of an educational resource has been
before the DC-Education Working Group since its face-to-face
meeting in Melbourne (Kattemingga Lodge) in February 2000.
Since 2000, DC-based applications in the education and
training domain have continued to develop local elements
and controlled vocabularies to record pedagogical statements.
It is considered by many in the education metadata community to
be the last critical class of statements in the DCMI namespaces
differentiating educational resources from other resources.
