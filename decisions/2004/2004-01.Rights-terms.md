Description: The decisions documented here refers to 
                proposals considered at the Usage Board meeting 
                of March 2004 in Bath UK.

Text of proposals: <a href="/usage/meetings/2004/03/dc-rights-proposal.html">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/03/dc-rights-proposal.html</a>

Decision: The Usage Board approves the addition of two
new properties: "license" as a refinement of dc:rights,
and an element "rightsHolder" as Conforming terms in the
dcterms namespace.

Discussion

Stuart Weibel, OCLC Office of Research, Andy Powell, UKOLN
University of Bath, and Eric Miller, World Wide Web Consortium,
proposed two new properties related to the dc:rights property
-- "license" and "rightsHolder". The DCMI Usage Board reviewed
the proposal at a meeting in Bath UK on Monday, 15 March
2004. Members present were Tom Baker (chair), Diane Hillmann,
Akira Miyazawa, Andy Powell, Roland Schwaenzl, Stuart Sutton,
Rebecca Guenther, and Andrew Wilson (designated shepherd of
the dc:rights-related terms proposal).

Although both terms were proposed with a status of Recommended,
the Usage Board decided to accept both terms with a status
of Conforming. The Usage Board took this decision because it
is possible to model the relationship(s) between both terms
in a variety of ways, and also because the proposed terms
are not clearly related to resource discovery across domains
although they do conform to Dublin Core grammatical principles.

The discussion of the proposal raised a significant issue
concerning the relationship between the two proposed terms and
what valid inferences can be drawn about the existence (or not)
of such a relationship. There is a view that information about
licenses typically requires the naming of the license holder,
the licensee, the resource which is the object of the license,
and possibly a validity period for the license, as well as the
document setting out the license terms and conditions. The
proposal submitted by Weibel, Powell and Miller made no
statements about the existence of a relationship between the
two terms. In fact, it was explicitly stated during discussion
that there is no implied or inherent relationship between
the two terms.

The two new terms enable the provision of metadata statements
that: 1) identify a license associated with a resource, and 
2) identify (or name) a person or organization holding rights
over the resource. However, consuming applications MUST NOT
infer that there is any relationship between the license(s)
and the rights holder(s) indicated in the metadata statements.

As described in the proposal, the two terms approved here
meet the very basic requirements to:

    * Support searches of the form "find all resources
      where an entity named using a simple string is a
      rights holder".

    * Support unambiguous searches of the form "find all
      resources where an entity that is identified using
      a URI is a rights holder".

    * Provide an unambiguous statement of the license
      under which the resource is made available, by
      providing a URI that identifies that license.

    * Support unambiguous searches of the form "find all
      resources which are made available under the terms
      of the license that has the following URI".

The Usage Board recognizes that meeting these basic
requirements may be insufficient for many applications.
The approval of these two "conforming" terms is not intended
to preclude the use of more sophisticated solutions or the
presentation of proposals for such solutions to the Usage
Board, although in light of the many rights-related activities
being carried out in the wider community the Board does not
encourage such proposals.

Definition: A legal document giving official permission to do something

Comment: Recommended best practice is to identify the license using a
                 URI. Examples of such licenses can be found at
