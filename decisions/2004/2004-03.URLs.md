Title: Replacing some obsolete URLs

It was discovered that the descriptions of the terms Format
[1] and IMT [2] cited a URL for Internet Media Types that
has apparently become obsolete [3]. This URL has been replaced
by one that works [4].

It was also discovered that the description of the term ISO3166
[5] cited a URL for ISO 3166 that is no longer appropriate to
use [6] and has been replaced by one that is more appropriate
[7].

To make these changes, three new term descriptions were created
[8,9,10].
