Decision: Merged into DCTerm accessRights

Note: The DCMI Usage Board decided that there appeared to be
significant overlap between the proposals for accessRights and
protectiveMarking. With the Board approval of accessRights
(<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/accessRights">http://purl.org/dc/terms/accessRights</a>), it was suggested
that protectiveMarkings be indicated using accessRights with
an associated vocabulary encoding scheme.
