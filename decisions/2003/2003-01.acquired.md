               in Florence. This particular decision is part of a cluster
               of decisions documented at

Decision: Rejected

The DCMI Usage Board decided that there was an insufficient
semantic distinction between the existing DC term Date Accepted
and the proposed term Acquired. This insufficient semantic
distinction raises the high probability of confusion in the
application of the term. The Board suggested that the DC
term dateAccepted (<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateAccepted">http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateAccepted</a>)
be used instead, and, if desired, "Date Acquired" might be
used as the term label in an application profile.
