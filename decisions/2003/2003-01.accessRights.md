Decision: Accept (with modified Definition and Comment)

Note: This decision merges two proposals, accessRights and
securityClassification, on the basis that:

-- there appeared to be significant overlap between the two
        proposals, and
-- protective markings can be indicated using the access rights
        qualifier with an associated vocabulary encoding scheme.
