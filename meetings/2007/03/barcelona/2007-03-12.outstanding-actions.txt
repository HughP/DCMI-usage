2007-03-13 Outstanding actions from Manzanillo and various telecons

ACTION 2006-10-01: Tom to replace the Principles document
at http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/ with a
page that copies the definitions of elements etc from DCAM
and includes a short text stating: that the document which
used to live here has been superseded by the DCAM. Update UB
page to say we do things in light of the DCAM.

ACTION 2006-10-01: Tom to look through DCMI site and note
those pages where a reference to the principles document
needs to be changed to a reference to the DCAM as appropriate.
