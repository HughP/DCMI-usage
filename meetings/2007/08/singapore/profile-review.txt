into account in revision the above:

Guidelines for application profiles, developed by the CEN
workshop in 2004, which will need to be updated in light of the
DSP model:

   ACTION 2007-06-08: Joe to revise
   http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/ProfileReviewCriteria
   in light of:
   http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/CollectionsProfileReviewNotes
   
   ACTION 2007-03-17: Stuart and Joe revise Term Decision Tree:
   http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/TermDecisionTree.
   (Note: the difference is basically String vs. Thing.)

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Joe to draft a document discussing
   issues related to principles and purpose of UB decision-making.
   (The context was the decision to define ISO639-2 as a set of codes.)
   Joe will work with Stuart on this (2007-06-08).

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Stuart and Joe to write
   a one-page explanation differentiating
   VES and SES, vet with Pete Johnston.  See:
   http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/Encoding-schemes.txt.
   Agreed: We need a deeper level of description and
   differentiation between VES and SES, including definitions.
   If you have a something already, how do you tell if it is
   VES or SES.  If an Encoding Scheme tells you what a value
   string it it's a SES.  If Encoding Scheme defines a class
   of values, then it is a VES (e.g., concepts).  For example,
   if you develop a list of educational levels, and if you
   define a list of strings, then you're defining an SES.
   If you define a set of concepts and assign URIs to them (as
   best practice), then you're defining a VES.  Best practice
   in this scenario is to define a set of concepts with URIs
   rather than a set of strings.  Agreed that DC-Education
   is a great test-bed for these concepts.  SES is a datatype
   in RDF.  VES is like conceptScheme in SKOS, only not limited
   to concepts.  For discussion: VES is a set of concepts that,
   once in metadata, allows editors to handle assertion by
   adding things to it.  SES is a set of strings.
