-- 2005-10-01: agenda item, Shanghai meeting
   http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/10/ISSUES/terms-accessibility/

Proposed definition

    Definition:  "A reference to a machine-readable profile
    that describes the qualities of a resource that can be
    used to match the needs and preferences of a user as
    expressed in a machine-readable user profile."

UB decision from the meeting notes (2005-10-10)

    Agreed to change definition to: "A description of the
    qualities of the resource in terms of control, display
    and content that can be used to match the needs and
    preferences of a user."

    Note: need to clarify comment to indicate what is meant
    by 'control, display and content' and to note that recommended
    best practice is to provide a machine-readable statement.

Subsequent discussion on the proposed definition:

-- One potential source of confusion is the notion of
   "access" in "accessibility", because "access" is used
   in DCMI terms and in other contexts to refer to much
   different things.

   -- The Oxford American dictionary defines "access" with
      words such as "reached, entered, or used".  Other
      dictionaries define "access" in terms of "approaching,
      entering, exiting, communicating with, or making use of"
      or "freedom or ability to obtain or make use of".

   -- In the DCMI term "accessRights", access is about
      obtaining a resource (as in "obtain a copy of").
      The proposed "Accessibility" element is not about this
      type of access.

   -- "Access" is used in the context of the Budapest Open
      Access Initiative specifically to refer to
      "free availability on the public Internet" (see
      http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#openaccess).
      In other words, it also is about access in the sense of
      "obtaining", which is not what the proposed Accessibility
      term is about.

   -- In the W3C world, accessibility is also about
      "intellectual accessibility" -- things like
      level of difficulty and language.  It also
      seems to have something to do with the ease
      with which a resource can be used.  According to
      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ut2/accessibility.html, Web
      accessibility means that people with disabilities can
      use the Web.  More specifically, Web accessibility means
      that the Web is designed so that people with disabilities
      can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it
      effectively, as well as create and contribute content to
      the Web.  Web accessibility addresses all disabilities,
      including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive,
      and neurological disabilities.

-- Bottom line: access-as-obtain and access-as-use are
   different things, even if the word "access" is often used
   to express both notions.  Somehow the definition of the
   new property needs to reflect that distinction.

-- Moreover, the proposed Accessibility element really seems to
   be specifically about "Web Accessibility" (i.e.,
   accessibility to digital resources in the context of the
   Web), though this is not stated explicitly in the definition
   or comment.  Could one, for example, use Accessibility to
   describe the accessibility of a building?  As proposed
   the term could be called "Web Accessibility", however
   this would seem to be a refinement of a broader notion
   of "Accessibility" -- not limited to digital resources.
   In fact, calling the term "Accessibility" when "Web
   Accessibility" was meant would make it difficult at a
   later date to create a broader term for accessibility.
   The Usage Board therefore felt it made more sense to
   broaden the definition of Accessibility explicitly to to
   include non-digital resources (and recognizing that "Web
   Accessibility" could in principle be proposed subsequently
   as a refinement of "Accessibility").

A broader definition was proposed, not limited to Web resources
and Web technology (2005-03-18):

    Definition: "A statement about the ease with which the
    resource can be accessed and used, regardless of the technology
    being used."

    Comment: "Factors that determine the ease of access
    and use of the resource include the control of the
    interface, the sensory modality of the resource as
    presented and variations in the expressive form of the
    information. Recommended best practice is to express
    the value in a machine-readable manner such as the W3C
    Evaluation and Reporting Language (EARL)."

Then questions were raised with regard to how the intended
use fits with the DCMI Abstract Model:

-- A statement made using the accessibility property doesn't
   actually describe the "accessibility" of the resource.
   Rather, it provides a basis for a process to take place --
   involving a description of the resource and a description
   of the user -- the outcome of which is an indication of
   the accessibility of that resource for that user.

-- In the understanding of the Usage Board, the Accessibility
   property is intended to describe a relation between a
   resource and a _description_ of that resource -- where that
   description describes those specific attributes of the
   resource that support such an "accessibility assessment"
   process.

-- The only descriptions the UB could find of how the
   "accessibility-related attributes
   description" is represented refer to XML --
   document-based, rather than statement-based (see
   http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_infov1p0.html).
   Given that the DCMI Abstract Model (now a recommendation) is
   closely aligned with RDF, it would be useful to understand
   how such an accessibility assessment process would be
   modeled in RDF.  In the understanding of the UB, the
   information that is represented in an "accessibility-related
   attributes description" is a set of statements about the
   resource -- the same resource as in the first description
   -- and in an RDF implementation there would be a set of
   properties to represent this (about use of colour, use of
   audio etc).  In an RDF environment, it is not clear why one
   would actually need an "accessibility" property at all, as
   the set of statements could be stored as a physical RDF/XML
   doc separate from the resource discovery description and
   one could use rdfs:seeAlso to point to "more statements"
   about the subject resource.

-- Such a use is not without precedent, as that is how some
   implementers understand dc:rights.  However, dc:rights
   may contain a string value made up of a rights statement.
   By analogy, it should be explicitly permissible to use an
   Accessibility element for an unstructured plain-literal
   "accessibility statement" (i.e., in words, as a string
   value).

-- Changing "machine-addressable" to "machine-readable"
   does not really address the underlying issue because plain
   string value and value URIs are all "machine-readable".
   Rather, the real issue seems to be its intended use for
   citing related descriptions.  If this is the case, then
   it is perhaps more helpful to say this in the comment,
   pointing users to the Abstract Model.

-- It was noted that defining dcterms:accessibility as a term
   which links to a separate description of the
   resource seems a bit like creating a new term called
   dcterms:libraryOrientedDescription and then using it to
   link to a MARC record.

-- As a minor point, we agreed that "sensory modality" seems
   like specialist jargon and needed to be re-worded for
   understandability.

Discussion of these modeling issues led us to take a closer 
look at EARL itself:

-- The "Example" entry in the table in [1] refers to IMS
   AccMD XML, and the "Comment" referred to [2,3], but neither
   illustrates exactly how it should be implemented.

   [3] http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_bestv1p0.html

-- The EARL 1.0 working draft spec [1] didn't seem to be
   linked from the EARL home page [2].  EARL development
   now seems to be under [3].  The status of these various
   documents is was not clear to us.

   [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/
   [2] http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/
   [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/

-- In section 3 of EARL 1.0, there is an example of an EARL
   assertion [1].  The (newer?) EARL 1.0 example is modelled
   slightly differently from the (older?) example shown
   on the EARL home page.  That old example seemed to be a
   simple "resource:X earl:passes test:Y" (with reification
   to say who asserted that).  The (newer?) model sidesteps
   reification and has the "assertor" (and also the subject
   resource, the test, the result etc) as a property
   of a resource of type earl:Assertion.  This new EARL
   1.0 model would seem to fit less cleanly into the DC
   "statements-about-the-subject-resource" framework
   (there is no longer an earl:passes property involved),
   so on this basis, there may be more grounds for that
   pointer-to-EARL-stuff property.

   [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/#assertion

-- If EARL is about (to quote the homepage): "evaluating web
   pages and web sites against the Web Accessibility Content
   Guidelines", then it is arguable whether the definition should
   be "A statement about the ease with which it is possible ...".
   Rather, it should be "A statement about the conformance of
   a resource to a particular accessibility benchmark" or words
   to that effect.

-- As implied in the proposed wording of the definition of
   Accessibility, the intended value would seem to be a second
   (albeit fairly long and complex) description of the resource
   -- one that uses attributes of the resource that are relevant
   in the context of how accessibile it is likely to be - color,
   use of images, etc.

-- The problems we had in finding good examples as a guide
   served to underline a more general, medium-term need for
   user guidance on the intended use of an Accessibility
   property.  In the short term, to help the Usage Board
   finalize this decision, the Usage Board would like to see a
   simple concrete example of how a DC description and an EARL
   assertion are used together and exactly where the proposed
   property fits in.  More to the point, the current wording
   of the Comment (below) still refers to EARL, but it is
   unclear whether it is yet appropriate to do so, and if so,
   what exactly should be cited.

This discussion has led the Usage Board to the current wording
on the table:

        Definition: A statement about the ease with which it
        is possible to use, interact with or comprehend the
        resource, regardless of the technology used.

        Comment: Ease of access encompasses the ability to
        perceive, understand, navigate, or interact with a
        resource -- digital or physical -- regardless of the
        technology being used.  For example, this element may
        be used for statements about the accessibility of a
        resource to people who are permanently or temporarily
        disabled.  Users wishing to associate this element
        with a description of a resource from the standpoint
        of accessibility -- a "related description" in terms
        of the DCMI Abstract Model [CITE] -- should consider
        expressing the value in a machine-readable language
        such as the W3C Evaluation and Reporting Language
        (EARL) [CITE].
