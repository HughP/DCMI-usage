In Washington, we should discuss and approve changes in the
Type Vocabulary [1].  Essentially, non-definitional text was
moved from the definitions into the Comment. 

In Shanghai, we decided to sign off on the changes after
"editorial consistencies" were corrected.  There was some
discussion on the list about wordings that we should review
[2].

For comparison, the version of the Type Vocabulary currently
posted is included in the packet [3].
