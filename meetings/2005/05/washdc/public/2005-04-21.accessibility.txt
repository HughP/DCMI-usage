I've had a private conversation with Tom about the definitions
below, and with Tom's consent, I've offered to share my own
observations.  These remarks are public, open, and shareable
with others, and of course brickbats are always welcome.
I've corrected in the text the typos Tom told me about.

  1. A description of the characteristics of a resource that may be 
  relevant to the accessibility needs and preferences of a user.

  2. A description of the characteristics of the resource which may 
  enable or inhibit users' sensory perception or control of the 
  resource or their intended engagement with the resource given 
  their special needs in the context.

In the interest of full disclosure, I'll say that Liddy shared
with me an earlier version, and I made some recommendations
that seem to have migrated (at least partially) into the first.
The first one is not too bad in my estimate, though there are
a couple words I'd still want to eliminate, but it is readable
and, with the exception of the circularity of using the word
'accessibility' in the definition, understandable.

The second definition I find overwrought.  It is twice as
long and half as clear.  No one will know what it means.
Approval of such a definition would, in my estimation,
elevate confusion to new heights.

I am given to understand that part of the problem of
wording is to make the definition sufficiently abstract that
things beyond information resources can be described with it
(buildings, events, and such).  This is probably a desireable
goal... we've always tried to make DC as general as we can.
But it substantially complicates the definition to do so.
I don't have an immediate solution for this (alert the media)
but I would like to give it a try, perhaps in a subsequent
post.

I do have a proposal about the underlying model for an
accessibility term that might simplify the task.  I know I
have not been party to these discussions, and if my remarks
are naïve or just wrong, ok, but I believe that you should
not reject my model without clear examples of how it fails.

My model:

Accessibility issues take place in a tripartite context:

resource ----- rendering device  -----  agent 

        domain A                domain B

I know that 'rendering device' is perhaps too
info-asset-specific... I don't have a better term at the
moment, but I'm confident that can be solved.

My assertion is that the definition can be made far more
succinct and clear if one avoids issues of 'user preference'
and 'user capabilities' (domain B interactions).  Accessibility
metadata should not be constructed to address those issues,
or cognitive issues, but rather to make it possible the
matching of device capabilities and resource attributes
(domain A interactions).

Domain B is important, of course, but is accommodated by a
marketplace that produces devices (screen readers, magnifying
glasses, wheel chairs, canes, crutches, etc).

The question for accessibility metadata is simply to
make it possible for a system to identify appropriate
resources that can be used in a given context.
(building_has_wheelchair_ramps, Device_renders_HTML_to_voice,
resource_encoded_according_to_ISO_12345, etc).

So now for the brickbats....?

My model from my previous post:

Accessibility issues take place in a tripartite context:

resource ----- rendering device  -----  agent 

        domain A                domain B


Domain A being the technical matching domain, and domain B being the
social and economic matching of devices between people and devices.

In thinking about this, it occurs to me that the marketplace rarely, if
ever, builds rendering devices without a clear specification to build
to, nor are buildings built to accommodate arbitrary access issues, but
rather are built to one or another legal specification.

Why not structure accessibility metadata to reflect this?  Its possible
that some cases might be missed, but isn't it the case that what we are
trying to promote is a declaration of conformance?  This averts the
problem of specifying a user's need/disability, and also the problem of
finding a generalization for the 'rendering device'.  

The definition might then become:

  1. A assertion of conformance of a resource to a public standard,
specification, or legal requirement pertaining to accessibility.

The acceptable values for such an element might include:
    - a formally maintained URI pointing to the standard, specification,
or legal requirement (preferred).
    - the Title of the standard, specification, or legal requirement
(less desireable, but probably still useful).

Hi, Pete,

Thanks for quickly responding to my modest proposal.   

I see the logic in your argument... It is homologous, at least to a
degree, to the educational standards element.

I personally have no considered opinion on whether this is in any
important way different.

The essence of my proposal is, I believe, agreeing on the model and
promoting practice based on that.  I am very curious as to whether the
model is acceptable to the accessibility group.  Indeed, my own
understanding of the problem in this way originated with discussions I
had with Liddy on the topic perhaps 2 years ago.  So, I was surprised to
find that it is not currently the way they are thinking.

In the terms of the Abstract Model, that URI and that title would be a
"value URI" and a "value string" respectively, and the "value" would be
the standard/specification/legal requirement itself.

However, taking the proposed definition and the comment about the values
together, it is slightly ambiguous whether the proposal is that

- the value is a standard
- the value is an assertion of conformance to a standard

I think there is a slight difference between those two things.

If the value is a standard, and a statement made using the property
dcterms:accessibility indicates an assertion of conformance to the
standard (which I'm fairly sure is the intent of your proposal), then
this seems pretty close to the existing property dcterms:conformsTo,
defined as

> A reference to an established standard to which the resource conforms.

(which if it was revised to be more DCAM-compatible would drop the "A
reference to" bit).

The only difference is the qualification that in the
dcterms:accessibility case it is a standard "pertaining to
accessibility". If this is the case, is a new, separate property
necessary? If a new property is necessary, then it seems to me it would
be a subproperty of dcterms:conformsTo....

what Stu says next is not at all to the issue, I am afraid.
The underlying model is not correct, sorry.

This was an early idea about how to deal with accessibility and it does 
not work.

Stu seems to be straying into device independence issues. Needs and 
preferences are vital in the accessibility context. People with 
disabilities often suffer from changes in their abilities due to such 
factors as tiredness etc and they also often have rights such as that 
they should have access to a dictionary that are then set aside in some 
special circs - eg when they are doing a spelling test. All these 
things have been worked out by people who understand the field and it 
is not a good idea to just guess what people with disabilities need.
It is also not true that we don't need to think about cognitive 
disabilities etc - very smart people have car accidents and strokes and 
their cognitive capacity can be affected in a variety of ways - people 
with dyslexia etc also are considered to be people suffering 
disabilities. Such people need to be accommodated.

This is not the case.
