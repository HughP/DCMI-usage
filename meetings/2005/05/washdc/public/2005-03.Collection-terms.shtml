Title:         Decision on a proposal for new terms for
               describing collections of resources
Shepherd:      Andrew Wilson
Identifier:    http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2005/2005-02.Collection-terms.shtml
Date:          2005-04-21
Description:   The decisions documented here refer to proposals
               considered at the Usage Board meeting of October 2004 
               in Shanghai, China.

Text of proposals:
-- Accrual Method (element)
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-accrualMethod/ 
-- Accrual Periodicity (element)
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-accrualPeriodicity/ 
-- Accrual Policy (element)
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-accrualPolicy/ 
-- Dublin Core Collection Description Accrual Method (encoding scheme)
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-DCCDAccrualMethod/ 
-- Dublin Core Collection Description Accrual Periodicity (encoding scheme)
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-DCCDAccrualPeriodicity/ 
-- Dublin Core Collection Description Accrual Policy (encoding scheme)
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-DCCDAccrualPolicy/ 

Decision:   The Usage Board approves the addition of
three new terms -- "accrualMethod", "accrualPeriodicity"
and "accrualPolicy" -- as conforming terms in the dcterms
namespace. The Usage Board deferred a decision on the three
proposed encoding schemes pending clarification of the ongoing
maintenance of the vocabularies.

Discussion

The Collection Description Working Group proposed the addition
of three new elements: "accrualMethod", "accrualPeriodicity",
and "accrualPolicy"; and three new encoding schemes:
"DCCDAccrualMethod", "DCCDAccrualPeriodicity", and
"DCCDAccrualPolicy", as part of its development of an
application profile for describing collections of resources.
The DCMI Usage Board reviewed the proposal at a meeting in
Shanghai China on Sunday, 10 October 2004. Members present were
Tom Baker(chair), Diane Hillmann, Akira Miyazawa, Andy Powell,
Stuart Sutton, Rebecca Guenther, and Andrew Wilson (designated
shepherd of the Collection Description terms proposal).

Discussion of the three elements was concerned largely with
the nature of "resource discovery" and whether the proposals
actually achieved the aims of DCMI for cross-domain resource
discovery. As a result of this discussion the Usage Board will
clarify what it actually means when it refers to "resource
discovery" and "cross-domain".

The three proposed elements and the three proposed encoding
schemes were considered together since the encoding schemes
were recommended as the source of values for the elements.
Some time ago the Usage Board considered a proposal for
additions to the DCMI Type vocabulary. At that time the
Board decided that it did not see itself either entertaining
additional proposals for expansion of DCMITYPE or managing
additional vocabularies of values to be used with DC elements
and element refinements. The Usage Board has two main concerns
about expanding the number of vocabulary encoding schemes
managed by DCMI:

       * The resources required to manage vocabularies at this
         level is considerable. The Usage Board is composed of
         up to nine members all volunteers with busy careers
         on the side -- who feel a sufficient enough challenge
         fulfilling the Board's primary mission;

       * Most of the suggestions or proposals for additional
         vocabularies are those that should be created and
         managed by specialist communities with sufficient
         expertise and motivation to do the job.

To a great extent, the process of developing vocabularies
is a social task, and not a technical task. As such it is
critical that the development be managed in the appropriate
domain. Usage Board members do not believe that the Usage
Board is the appropriate domain for such an activity.

The Usage Board decided to reserve its decision on the proposed
encoding schemes and to seek clarification of the role of
the Board in this area, from the Trustees. Consequently,
references to specific encoding schemes in the element
proposals were removed.
