Not sure these thoughts are helpful at this point! ;-)

First, I also had some doubts about the name of the property. I
had grasped this aspect of a process matching resource
description and user description, and for this very reason I
always wondered about whether "accessibility" was the right
name for a property of a resource ;-) Because (according to
this very principle of accessibility being the result of a
process), a statement made using the accessibility property
doesn't actually describe the "accessibility" of the resource,
if you see what I mean! It just provides a basis for a process
to take place (involving a description of the resource and a
description of the user), the outcome of which is an indication
of the accessibility of that resource for that user.

Secondly, I must admit I was struggling to grasp the underlying
model here. I did have a couple of exchanges with Liddy and
one of her colleagues before Shanghai, but they weren't able
to provide any examples of how this was implemented in RDF
(and I got too busy and didn't pursue it). It seems to
me that as proposed the accessibility property describes
a relation between a resource and a _description_ of that
resource - where that description describes those specific
attributes of the resource that support the "accessibility
assessment" process). The information that is represented in
this "accessibility-related attributes description" is a set
of statements about the resource - the same resource as in
the first description - and in an RDF implementation there
would be a set of properties to represent this (about use
of colour, use of audio etc. It seems to me in this model
you would never actually need an "accessibility" property
at all! If this set of statements was stored as a separate
physical RDF/XML doc from the resource discovery description,
then you'd just use rdfs:seeAlso to indicate there was more
stuff about the subject resource.

But the only descriptions I can find of how the
"accessibility-related attributes description" is represented
refer to XML - document-based, rather than statement-based,
specifically

http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_infov1p0.html

so it doesn't really help disentangle this.

Having said all this, I'm conscious that the dc:rights
property takes a very similar approach to that suggested
for the accessibility property - I think effectively often a
dc:rights property points to another "description" (which has
statements about the same resource covering those attributes
of the resource that are concerned with rights) - so there
is a precedent. OTOH, I think this aspect of dc:rights has
caused us a few headaches as well, and I'm not sure that if
we were starting again we'd take the same approach.

Oh dear. Not sure that was constructive at this point in
the proceedings!

OK.

I think my concern touches on your comment here. dc:rights and the
proposed property (maybe dc:description too) adopt a slightly different
modelling "style" from the other properties. What I mean by that is I
think most of the other properties are deployed to describe a
relationship between the subject resource and another thing

resource-R is-created-by person-P
resource-R has-as-topic concept-C

and so on.

OK, so does dc:rights, and the other thing is a "rights statement". OK,
but suppose I have a description which includes:

resource-R has-rights-statement statement-S

Now, in the case of dc:rights that other thing is, or a least may be, or
may include, a description of, resource-R! i.e. statement S might be an
RDF/XML document containing the statement

resource-R is-available-under-license license-L

So, hang on a minute... why didn't we just say that (using
dcterms:license)? What is the difference between the two approaches?

And why do we say

resource-R has-rights-statement statement-S

rather than

resource-R see-Also statement-S

(using rdfs:seeAlso, which is how you would usually say "more data about
this over here").

As you point out, I think the reason is that we are trying to allow for
both unstructured plain literal "rights statements" and resources as
rights-statements.

I think this really goes back to the more general value-as-resource v
value-as-literal debate. Most RDF vocabularies (I think) don't allow
this choice. Properties which can have literal values are defined to
always have literal values; properties that have other resources as
values don't take literals as values. Now in the Abstract Model, we've
said values are always resources and although we haven't worked out how
this is going to be implemented in RDF, I'm guessing we'll say the
dc:rights RDF property never has a plain literal value, but it could
have some intermediate node with a literal value hanging off it. I'm not
sure that really solves the problem but I haven't thought that bit
through....

I dunno... maybe it's all a non-problem, but the fact that it leads to
some slightly odd questions leaves me with niggling doubts about whether
the underlying approach is quite right. But I appreciate that is a very
vague specification of the problem! ;-)

I was/am really curious to see how the Accessibility people address this
in RDF partly because, well, I just want to know (!), and partly because
I think if they have worked through some of these issues it would
provide some very useful models to guide us. (Andy and I had a brief
chat about this earlier and he commented that similar issues will arise
in the ODRL-DC work that is in progress.) But most of the references I
find are to EARL, and all that material seems to be dated 2001 and I'm
not clear what its status is. And while I think I understand broadly
what EARL does, I'm rather less clear about how it integrates with e.g.
a DC metadata description. From my fairly hasty reading of it, I'm not
really sure I see a need for a dcterms:accessibility property to
reference an EARL statement, just for rdfs:seeAlso to say "there's some
more RDF data over here".

Hmmm... actually, I disagree with this.  Access Rights is
about whether someone has rights to obtain (a copy of) the
resource.  It is not primarily about 'use' I don't think?  So,
for example, access to a bit of shareware software may be free
provided that a registration process is gone thru but the usage
of that software may be limited by licence to 1 month's use.
Access Rights is about the former but not about the latter in
my view.  In DCMI terms, the latter is now covered by License.

As an aside, given your dislike of defining Accessibility using the word
'access', I note that in the definition of Access Rights we do not really
define what we mean by access (which is used in both the definition and
the comment).  Oh well :-(

>        Definition: A statement about the ease with which

Sorry, but my personal view is that replacing 'accessed' by 'obtained'
here really doesn't help much.  In fact, the combination of 'obtained' and
'or' is actually worse, since it allows a statement to be made only about
how easy it is to obtain the resource - which IMHO is not necessarily an
'accessibility' statement at all.

In any case, I thought you wanted to differentiate the 'access' in
accessibility from the 'access' in access rights.  By using 'obtain and
use' you made them exactly the same ('reach and use')??  If access means
the same in both cases, why not just use 'access' in both?

So, I would prefer to stick with 'accessed and/or used' with 'obtained
and/or used' being second best.

I quite like your comment, though I note that having removed 'accessed'
from the definition, it feels odd to me to start with 'Ease of access
encompasses ...'??

The problem I think is that with both your definition and mine, the
statement "The resource is freely available" is a valid value (given the
definitions and without looking at the comments) but isn't what we mean by
accessibility.

A resource can be 'open access' but inaccessible.

I think we need to spell out what 'access' means in the context of
accessibility in the definition, rather than in the comment. So,
re-casting your comment slightly gives...

"A statement about the ease with which it is possible to access, use,
interact with or comprehend the resource"?

And... for the record, I still think that this, and the first sentence of
your comment, is just as much a definition of 'usability' as a definition
of 'accessibility'.  It is the 'regardless of the technology being used'
bit that is critical here IMHO, and therefore that bit should remain in
the definition.

Which I think leaves my preferred option as something like

"A statement about the ease with which it is possible to access, use,
interact with or comprehend the resource, regardless of the technology
being used"

Sorry :-(

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was keeping out of these discussions, but I skimmed Tom's proposed
definition as it joined my email backlog and my reaction was similar to
Andy's.

I particularly agree with this point:

> A resource can be 'open access' but inaccessible.

I don't think "accessibility" (as intended in the initial property
proposal) was about accessing-as-obtaining a resource, "getting to" the
resource, if you like. The initial definition proposed in

http://www.ozewai.org/DC-term-proposal/prop-reqs-table2.html

was:

====
A reference to a machine-readable profile that describes the qualities
of a resource that can be used to match the needs and preferences of a
user as expressed in a machine-readable user profile.
====

The proposal referenced the IMS Accessibility work, and it may be useful
to look at section 3 of

http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_oviewv1p0.htm
l

for an idea of what "qualities of the resource" were in mind:

===
# Access Modality: Whether the user requires vision, hearing, touch
and/or text literacy to access the resource.
# Adaptability: How amenable the resource is to transformation of the
display and whether the method of control is flexible (display
transformability and control flexibility).
# Equivalent: Whether there is a known equivalent alternative.
===

It seems fairly clearly about accessing-as-using the resource, "getting
into" the resource, once I have "obtained" it - though of course the
description of those attributes that condition access-as-use may be used
to discover the resource in the first place.

I think access-as-obtain and access-as-use are different things, even if
the word "access" is often used to express both notions, and - somehow!
;-) - the definition of the new property needs to reflect that
distinction.

Okay, I agree; point taken.

Right... -- and I figured that using it in two different ways
in two different definitions without defining it even once
might be going a bit too far... ;-)

Hmm, is Accessibility really about "obtaining" at all...?

Okay, I like this.  I'm just wondering whether the word "access" is
really necessary...

Okay, but is there really any reason why the element could not
or should not be called "usability" (except for the obvious
fact that it was proposed by a community that talks about
"accessibility")?  Typing "usability studies" into Google,
right near the top I see a report on "usability tests with
users with disabilities" filed under "accessibility".

It is still not clear to me why the definition needs to refer
to "technology" because, to me, there is nothing in the phrase
"to access, use, interact with or comprehend the resource"
which implies that technology is being used at all.

So my suggestion would be to use your definition, but minus
"access" and minus "regardless...":

    A statement about the ease with which it is possible to
    use, interact with or comprehend the resource.

This is helpful.  Nothing in there about "obtaining" in the
sense of "discovering" or "fetching".  Hmm, except perhaps
with regard to equivalent alternatives.

Yes, that states the contrast nicely.  Since we have already
used "access" in its "obtain" meaning for accessRights, using
it in the definition for Accessibility arguably muddies the
waters by implying that "obtaining" the resource is part of
what Accessibility is about.  Again:

    A statement about the ease with which it is possible to
    use, interact with or comprehend the resource.

Subject: Re: "Accessibility" decision - proposed wording
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know about anyone else, but I would find it helpful to see some
example values for Accessibility, as intended by the proposers.  Can we
ask Liddy to supply some?  Were there examples in the original proposal?

We know that EARL fits in somewhere, but if I'm honest, I don't really
know what an EARL statement looks like or does!  My understanding is that
EARL is a language for recording the conformance of a resource against a
particular benchmark.  So, in this case, EARL would presumably be used to
make a staement about whether a resource conforms to WAI or not?

>From the EARL homepage...

--- cut ---
  EARL would initially be a means for expressing in a machine readable form
  ...

     * Results of evaluating web pages and web sites against the Web
       Accessibility Content Guidelines
--- cut ---

It is therefore arguable whether the definition should be "A statement
about the ease with which it is possible ..." - rather it should be "A
statement about the conformance of a resource to a particular
accessibility benchmark" or words to that effect.

But it is also possible that the intended 'value' of Accessibility is a
complete chunk of XML that conforms to the IMS Accessibility spec.  If so,
then things get quite complex because the IMS spec references
EARL statements itself (several times).

As hinted in the original wording of the definition of Accessibility

  A description of the qualities of the resource in terms of control,
  display and content that can be used to match the needs and preferences
  of a user.

the value looks to be a second (albeit fairly long and complex)
description of the resource - but one that uses attributes (qualities!) of
the resource that are relevant in the context of how accessibile it is
likely to be - colour, use of images, etc.

Defining dcterms:accessibility as a term which links to a separate
description of the resource is a bit like creating a new term called
dcterms:libraryOrientedDescription and then using it to link to a MARC
record.

As PeteJ has argued in the past, if there are useful attributes
defined in the IMS Accessibility spec then (provided they are
declared as RDF properties) we can use them directly in our
descriptions - we don't need a new Accessibility property
in order to do that.  (Just as we are doing with the MARC
relator terms from the library world).

So, I must admit that I'm totally confused about what we are
achieving (or even trying to achieve) here.

My personal view is that it looks as though we were wrong
to approve this term in Shanghai - and that it is better to
admit that now than to move forward on shaky ground.

I urge us not to do anything more on this without involving
Liddy and without getting some concrete example values
from her.

The "Example" entry in the table in

http://www.ozewai.org/DC-term-proposal/prop-reqs-table2.html

refers to IMS AccMD XML, and the "Comment" referred to

http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_oviewv1p0.html
http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_bestv1p0.html

But neither illustrates exactly how it should be implemented.

The EARL 1.0 working draft spec

http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/

didn't seem to be linked from the EARL home page

http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/

:-(

FWIW, EARL development now seems to be under

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/

Anyway, down in section 3 of EARL 1.0, there is an example of an EARL
assertion

http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/#assertion

I noticed that that (newer?) EARL 1.0 example is modelled slightly
differently from the (older?) example shown on the EARL home page.

That old example seemed to be a simple

resource:X earl:passes test:Y

(with reification to say who asserted that)

The (newer?) model sidesteps reification (I think) and has the
"assertor" (and also the subject resource, the test, the result etc) as
a property of a resource of type earl:Assertion.

So I can see that this new EARL 1.0 model would fit less cleanly into
the DC "statements-about-the-subject-resource" framework (there is no
longer an earl:passes property involved), so on this basis, there may be
more grounds for that pointer-to-EARL-stuff property.

Yes, I agree.

The W3C documentation on this stuff does seem to be rather fragmented,
and even when I manage to find stuff, I end up guessing about what is
the most current.

And yes, I would just like to see a simple concrete example of how a DC
description and an EARL assertion are used together and exactly where
the proposed property fits in.
