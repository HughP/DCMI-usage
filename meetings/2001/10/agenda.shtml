-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Monday morning, 9:00-12:00 -- 3'00" with 15" break
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. Guidelines for encoding schemes and subject 
     vocabularies (Traugott, others?)

    We need to clarify the process, workflow, and guidelines for
    fast-track approval.  Traugott has revised the guidelines we
    discussed in May and will present these.  See
    [PACKET 1.1.1: http://www.lub.lu.se/~traugott/drafts/vocab-guide2.html],
    posted on 8 October.

    With regard to process, we should review Stu's recent addition
    to the FAQ, mirrored at:
    [PACKET 1.1.2: http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/2001-10-10.dc-usage.faq-questions.html].

    Items under consideration for fast-track include:

        RFC 3066, Rebecca's proposal, see
            [PACKET 1.1.3: http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/rfc3066_proposal.doc]
        Ethnologue language terms (Diane)
        Identifier encoding schemes: ISSN, DOI, SICI, OpenURL... (Andy)
            [PACKET 1.1.4: http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0109&L=dc-usage&F=&S=&P=3385].
        [PACKET 1.1.5: http://www.lub.lu.se/~traugott/drafts/DC-Vocabulary-Qualifiers.html]

    Harry has prototyped an encoding scheme Web page at
    [PACKET 1.1.6: http://wip.dublincore.org/Schemes.html screen-shot].
    We should try to agree on a standard Web form for submitting proposals.


1.2.  DC-Government proposal (Stuart)

    This is the main agenda item, for which we might need two hours.
    I have mirrored the version we will discuss at
    [PACKET 1.2.1: http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/DC-Gov_proposal_v0.2_2001-10-121.doc]

    See also http://dublincore.org/groups/government.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Meeting some evening, to be planned, eg 19:00-22:00?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Update and wrapup of Namespace issue, implications for Usage Board (Andy)

    Background: 
    [PACKET 2.1.1: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/]

    What happened to the DCMI Persistence Policy which used to be at
    http://dublincore.org/about/persistence?

2.2.  Usage Board process (Diane)

    Diane will summarize UB process as described in the
    revised document and recap the process by which that
    document was approved by AC.

    Relevant documents are:
    -- "Procedure for approval of DCMI Metadata Terms and
       Recommendations", [PACKET 2.1.2: http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/approval].
    -- "Usage Board administrative process",
       [PACKET 2.1.3: http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process].

    Diane has also worked on a revised "Criteria for Evaluation
    of Proposals", posted to the list and mirrored at
    [PACKET 2.1.4: http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/2001-10-15.Dc-usage.diane.Proposed_Section_3.3.doc].
    This would replace the current "Criteria" draft at
    [PACKET 2.1.5: http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/criteria].

    One urgent set of process issues concerns the workflow for
    documenting decisions made at meetings.
    I would suggest that shepherds be responsible
    for getting approval of the final form of their documents.  

    I suggest that the drafter submit the document to the dc-usage
    list with Cc: to Beth for posting on the meeting follow-up
    page.  The drafters should clearly indicate that they are
    submitting the document for close reading and final approval.
    During the course of a one-month comment period, every member
    of the Usage Board should sign off (if only with a one-on-one
    message to the drafter) on every such deliverable.  The drafter
    should keep track of who has signed off.  If we agree on this
    process, we should perhaps add it to our process document.

2.2.  Agent issues: ways forward (Diane)

    We discussed this on the list back in June, and
    Diane has produced a summary mirrored at:
    [PACKET 2.1.6: http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/2001-10-18.Dc-usage.diane.AGENTs.doc]

    See also the Agent issues to be discussed in a Tokyo breakout
    session on 23 October:
    [PACKET 2.1.7: http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0110&L=dc-general&O=A&P=3646]

2.3. Documentation of Usage Board results (Tom, Stu/Harry, Rachel)

    A working paper
    http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/UB-Doc.html was used as
    the basis for overhauling the Web pages at
    http://dublincore.org/usage.  This document will be updated in
    response to discussion on the list and turned into a manual for
    maintaining the UB Web pages.  Rachel Heery of the DCMI
    Registry Working Group will also participate in the
    discussions so that we can clarify the relationship between
    the Usage Board and Registry activities.  The agenda of the
    DC-9 meeting of the Registry WG is at 
    http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0110&L=dc-general&O=A&P=4096.

    In particular see:
    -- Registry prototype: http://wip.dublincore.org:8080/registry/
    -- Functional requirements: http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/~lisrmh/DCMI-registry/funreq.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Longer-term issues for "bar BOFs"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.  Application profiles (Andy, Tom)

    On May 21 (at the Dublin meeting) we decided that:
    a. UB is not concerned with application profiles.
    b. UB is not concerned with other namespaces.
    c. Recommendation: UB shouldn't approve application profiles.
       DCMI Registry should be responsible for registering application 
       profiles.

    The issue here is by what process, and according to which
    criteria, DCMI should be in the business of reviewing,
    recognizing, or just plain registering application profiles.
    Andy and I have been planning to write up some strawman
    guidelines for application profiles and have not yet gotten to
    this.  One issue is that of APs as human-readable Web pages, as
    in http://dublincore.org/documents/library-application-profile,
    which is discussed in:
    http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0108&L=dc-general&O=A&P=274
    http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0108&L=dc-general&O=A&P=673

    Ideally, however, we would have more detailed guidelines for
    expressing such profiles machine-understandably, eg along the
    lines described in a paper by Makx, Rachel, Manjula, Gauri, and
    myself to appear soon in JODI:
    http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/Profiles.pdf.

3.2.  DC-Citation (Andy)

3.3.  Naming policy, dct:alternative vs dct:alternativeTitle (Andy)

3.4.  Are element refinements "elements" or "qualifiers"? (Tom, Andy)

    The broader issue is that of our grammar, and whether we need
    an updated grammar paper.  A related issue from a DCMI
    registry perspective is the technical question of whether a
    metadata term's grammatical category (element, encoding
    scheme, etc) should be expressed in the base RDF schema
    encoding the DCMI namespace or expressed as an RDF annotation
    to that schema.

3.5. Reviewing or endorsing translations of DCMI Metadata Terms (Tom)
    
    We need to think, for the longer term, about whether, who,
    and how translations of DCMI metadata terms should be
    reviewed for quality and certified by DCMI.

3.6. Definition of the Title element (Roland)
    
    See Roland's comments, mirrored at
    http://www.gmd.de/People/Thomas.Baker/2001-10-03.Dc-usage.title-issue.html

ADDENDUM TO AGENDA, USAGE BOARD MEETING OF 22 OCTOBER, TOKYO<br>Version: Fri Oct 19 12:32:27 MEST 2001</PRE>
<p><br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  Query from Alan Lillich, Adobe Systems Incorporated, 17 September 2001<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Sent: Monday, September 17, 2001 8:14 PM<br>
  To: DC-GENERAL@JISCMAIL.AC.UK<br>
  Subject: Re: Repeating DC elements</p>
<p>It has been very interesting to watch the recent discussion on repeating<br>
  elements. I think the focus on personal choices is missing some important<br>
  broader issues.</p>
<p>The use of DC metadata will become much more valuable if we can achieve a<br>
  high degree of commonality. Like the standardization of railroad gauges,<br>
  it is not so important that you have a semicolon separated list of keywords,<br>
  repeated simple keyword elements, or in the case of RDF one keyword element<br>
  containing a bag of individual words. It is more important that metadata<br>
  written by one piece of software be understood by another.</p>
<p>There are (at least) two established and one emerging class of participants<br>
  in the DC metadata game. The established players are the DCMI and<br>
  significant end users of DC metadata. The end users are largely<br>
  distinguished by defining their own databases and producing their own custom<br>
  implementations. They are often in a situation where the metadata is the<br>
  goal.</p>
<p>The emerging participants are the volume software vendors and their<br>
  customers who can benefit from reliable metadata for all of their electronic<br>
  documents. Adobe finds itself in this situation. We are in the process of<br>
  adding RDF and DC-based metadata support to all of our applications.<br>
  Acrobat 5 is the first to ship with some of this support. (For those who<br>
  have used Acrobat 5, it does not embody the final or definitive<br>
  implementation. It was first, and as usual for software it does not do<br>
  everything we want to do.)</p>
<p>Adobe needs to make choices about the UI we present and the metadata we<br>
  write. We can't afford to spend the time and money to provide ultimate<br>
  flexibility. Much as we might wish, we can't canvas all or even a<br>
  significant portion of our users ahead of time. We need to provide a common<br>
  approach in all our applications that is useful for our customers, and that<br>
  can be utilized by other software to provide additional value.</p>
<p>We think it would be tremendously helpful for the DCMI to provide guidance<br>
  and suggested good practice for the use of DC metadata in unclear areas like<br>
  repeating elements. These should not have the weight of standards, but<br>
  guidance to help choose a representation and to transform among<br>
  representations. Policy for logically equivalent representations so that<br>
  software recognizes all legitimate forms. Perhaps standard qualifiers to<br>
  denote encodings like semicolon separated keywords.</p>
<p>For those of us using RDF, localization through the xml:lang attribute is<br>
  another area where it is easy to construct ambiguous examples. Suppose you<br>
  have a book with two authors, one American and one Japanese. And the book<br>
  is published in both the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>For the title an rdf:Alt container makes the localization explicit, although<br>
  repeated title properties with xml:lang attributes should be clear at least<br>
  to a human (but only because of the semantic knowledge that books don't have<br>
  multiple titles).</p>
<p>Suppose the Japanese author wishes to have separate Romanji and Kanji names<br>
  for the US and Japan. Use of simple repeated properties would be ambiguous,<br>
  indistinguishable from a case of three authors. Again use of an rdf:Alt<br>
  container for the Japanese author makes things clear. And use of an rdf:Bag<br>
  or rdf:Seq container for both authors makes it clear whether there is any<br>
  hierarchy.</p>

  Query from Eddie Byrne &lt;Eddie.Byrne@comhairle.ie&gt;,<br>
  Irish Public Service Metadata Project Co-ordinator, 26 September 2001<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Eddie Byrne sent a query to dc-general last May and got some responses,<br>
  attached below, but the responses were inconclusive. He is looking for<br>
  additional guidance:</p>
<p>Byrne&gt; Issue: use of case for DC qualifiers in HTML<br>
  Byrne&gt;<br>
  Byrne&gt; Choice between: (example) DC.Relation.isFormatOf or<br>
  Byrne&gt; DC.Relation.IsFormatOf (note the difference in case)<br>
  Byrne&gt;<br>
  Byrne&gt; Why am I confused? Because the explanation and examples given at both<br>
  Byrne&gt; http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-qualifiers/ and<br>
  Byrne&gt; http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/08/15/dcq-html/ are contradictory<br>
  Byrne&gt; and do not explain the reasoning.<br>
  Byrne&gt;<br>
  Byrne&gt; I am currently recommending that which is indicated as the Name of 
  the<br>
  Byrne&gt; qualifier as that which is to be appended to the element (i.e.<br>
  Byrne&gt; isFormatOf). The only rationale I can give is that in the event of<br>
  Byrne&gt; migration to xhtml or xml the lower case convention is already<br>
  Byrne&gt; practiced and minimum disruption occurs. Does that explanation make<br>
  Byrne&gt; sense, or more precisely, is it correct?</p>
<p>[message from Eddie Byrne to DC General Discussion list in May 2001]</p>
<p>Forgive me, I know that this discussion was had in May 1999 (as per<br>
  archives search), but the outcome seemed inconclusive (at least re.<br>
  html). Rdf/xml lower case seems a foregone conclusion, but what about<br>
  HTML, or more specifically the case of qualifiers? For example.<br>
  DC.Relation.IsVersioOf or DC.Relation.isVersionOf ? DC site examples<br>
  indicate the first as the case to use, however I not that AGLS<br>
  specifies the second. What might be the now accepted case convention if<br>
  there is such a thing? Or might someone explain why AGLS differ? Is the<br>
  AGLS case determined in any way by issues of migration? Or does it<br>
  matter?</p>
<p>Eddie Byrne</p>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<p>Hi Eddie and other colleagues,</p>
<p>Funnily enough, we were looking at just this issue yesterday when I was<br>
  reviewing our metadata standards against AGLS and other Australioan<br>
  government recommendations. HealthInsite aims to be AGLS-compliant but<br>
  it was pointed out that we use the DC convention for case in element<br>
  refinements. When I was developing the HealthInstie standards there was<br>
  a lot of guess-work because DC and AGLS were developing at the same<br>
  time. My feeling is that the issue is trivial and that harvester<br>
  software can easily be adapted to ignore any case differences in the<br>
  metadata syntax.</p>
<p>Regards, Prue Prue Deacon<br>
  HealthInsite Editorial Team<br>
  Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care (Australia)</p>
<p>Response 2:</p>
<p>Eddie</p>
<p>As Prue noted in her reply AGLS was a qualified metadata standard<br>
  before DC had agreed on its qualifier set. For that reason we had to<br>
  make a number of decisions about practical matters before DCMI had<br>
  finalised its position on such matters. The AGLS capitalisation<br>
  convention was based on earlier versions of the proposal set out in the<br>
  paper &quot;Recording qualified Dublin Core metadata in HTML meta elements&quot;<br>
  at: http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/08/15/dcq-html/. To date this<br>
  is the only example of a convention for writing element refinements and<br>
  it specifies the convention followed by AGLS (although not in so many<br>
  words - lok at the examples) i.e. for element refinements the first<br>
  letter of the refinement name is in lower case and the inital letter of<br>
  any and all subsequent words which make up the refinement name are in<br>
  upper case e.g. DC.Date.modified and DC.Relation.isVersionOf and<br>
  DC.Relation.hasFormat.</p>
