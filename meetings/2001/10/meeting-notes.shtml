<h1>DCMI Usage Board - Tokyo meetings</h1>
<p> <i><b>Meeting 1</b></i></p>
<p> Monday, 22 Oct 2001</p>
<p> NII, Tokyo</p>
<p> Present: Stuart Sutton, Roland Schw&auml;nzl, Haruki Nagata, Traugott Koch, 
  Diane Hillmann, Tom Baker, Andy Powell</p>
<p> Agenda for Monday morning:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> 1. Government proposal</p>
  <p> 2. Schema issues/Registry</p>
  <p> (Guidelines for encoding schemes and subject vocabularies deferred to evening 
    meeting.)</p>
  <p> General issues&#133;</p>
  <p> Monday DC-Architecture WG workshop meeting re-aligned as Architecture/Usage 
    Board/Registry meeting. Need representation from UB at this meeting.</p>
  <p> General documentation issues (Web site, etc.) to be handled in evening meeting. 
  </p>
  <p> <b>Government Proposal</b></p>
  <p> Shepherd - Stuart Sutton</p>
  <p> General issues&#133;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> What parts of this proposal are we concerned with? The extensions outlined 
      in section 3.</p>
    <p> Can app profiles re-define elements and qualifiers?</p>
    <p> What interest does UB have in app profiles?</p>
    <p> Need agreed definition of &quot;application profile&quot; - Tom to draft 
      proposal by next UB meeting.</p>
    <p> UB will review proposed application profiles from DCMI WGs and other significant 
      community initiatives and consider any proposed elements and qualifiers 
      within DCMI namespaces for approval.</p>
    <p> UB/Registry will register application profiles from DCMI WGs and other 
      significant community initiatives (this involves checking that app profile 
      is 'well formed'). Registration does not imply 'recommendation'.</p>
    <p> <b>DC-Government proposal</b></p>
    <p> <b>audience</b> - ACKNOWLEDGE. Same as existing dcterms:audience element 
      - Stuart to communicate that this is not a new element but otherwise usage 
      of this element is fine.<br>
    </p>
    <p>(Note: need to improve communication of UB decisions - knowledge about 
      approval of audience not widespread).</p>
    <p> Date <b>acquired</b> - REJECT. Valid refinement for dc:date but not within 
      scope of DCMI - administrative rather than discovery-oriented. Use another 
      namespace - Stuart to communicate this back to WG. Suggest liaison with 
      Admin Metadata WG.</p>
    <p> Relation <b>isBasedOn/isBasisFor</b> - RESUBMIT. Valid refinement but 
      definition too fuzzy and not consistent with provided examples. Confusion 
      with existing isVersionOf refinement. Suggest WG provides new/clearer definition 
      of isBasedOn and, if necessary, suggest changes in wording of IsVersionOf. 
      Stu/Diane to write rejection text. Need input from broader community - dc-general.</p>
    <p> Rights <b>accessRights/copyright</b> - RESUBMIT. Full proposal required.</p>
    <p> Rights <b>accessMarking</b> - RESUBMIT. Full proposal required.</p>
    <p> Rights <b>previousAccessMarking</b> - REJECT - not cross-domain discovery 
      oriented. Administrative in nature.</p>
    <p> Rights <b>previousAccessMarkingChangeDate</b> - REJECT - not valid refinement 
      for dc:rights. Date is not refinement.</p>
    <p> Subject <b>category</b> - REJECT. Valid refinement but should be handled 
      using an encoding scheme.</p>
    <p> Subject<b> keyword </b>- RESUBMIT. Proposal as it stands is confusing, 
      e.g. DDC not a keyword. New definition required. Need to clarify differences 
      between unqualified dc:subject and proposed keyword refinement.</p>
    <p> Type <b>aggregationLevel/dossierType/itemType</b> - REJECT. Valid refinement 
      but should be handled using an encoding scheme. Suggest considering a hierarchical 
      encoding scheme and/or consulting with different jurisdictions within government 
      domain.<br>
    </p>
    <p>(Note: this is an example of a more general problem concerning when to 
      use encoding schemes vs. when to use element refinements - guidance on this 
      needs to be written up. Stuart to provide material from SCHEMAS workshop 
      for comment).</p>
    <p> Review of comments/definitions:</p>
    <p> Audience - fine.<br>
      Contributor - fine.<br>
      Spatial - fine<br>
      Temporal - fine<br>
      Creator - fine (but note comment possibly moves beyond resource discovery)<br>
      Date - fine<br>
      Description - fine<br>
      Format - fine<br>
      Identifier - fine (but note that ISBN and ISSN still to be registrered)<br>
      Language - fine<br>
      Publisher - move dc-gov definition to best practice and possibly change 
      'is' to 'may be'<br>
      Relation - remove refrence to aggregationLevel in dc-gov definition<br>
      Relation/isPartOf - remove reference to aggregationLevel<br>
      Rights - fine<br>
      Source - fine<br>
      Subject - fine<br>
      Title - fine (but note potential difference with DC-Libraries app profile)<br>
      Type - fine</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Next meeting: Tuesday evening - 7.00pm venue to be decided.</p>
  <p> <i><b>Meeting 2</b></i></p>
  <p> 8.00pm, Tuesday, 23 Oct 2001</p>
  <p> NII, Tokyo</p>
  <p> <b>Guidelines for registration of vocabulary and encoding scheme qualifiers</b></p>
  <p> Traugott to update document based on agreed changes, as follows:</p>
  <p> 1.2 Remove 2nd sentence.</p>
  <p> Add new introduction before 1.</p>
  <p> 2.3 Remove reference to 'conforming'. Replace 'included in&#133;' by 'included 
    in the DCMI registry'. Add sentence to indicate that registered scheme names 
    will be added to the dcterms namespace.</p>
  <p> 2.4 Change wording to state that 'the registrant should provide' rather 
    'the list should provide'.</p>
  <p> Change 'contact person' to 'maintenance agency contact person'.</p>
  <p> Add 'submitter email address'.</p>
  <p> Note: the Web form that asks for this information must have statement of 
    what we will do with personal date - e.g. link to generic DCMI privacy statement.</p>
  <p> Note: UB needs to consider post submission process and how we contact submitter 
    and/or maintenance agency before registration.</p>
  <p> Note: may need process for de-registering schemes (at some point in the 
    future).</p>
  <p> Note: may need mechanism for checking validity of data (at some point in 
    the future).</p>
  <p> Change 'name' to 'full name' and 'token/acronym' to 'abbreviated name (acronym)'.</p>
  <p> Expand example to include labels, one per line.</p>
  <p> Email Joan Mitchell to check about including her name on page.</p>
  <p> 3.1.1 Change 'are' to 'may be'. Change 'trusted authorities' to 'recognized 
    entities'.</p>
  <p> 3.2.3 A subset of an official scheme, where terms are unaltered, may not 
    be registered separately.</p>
  <p> Note: there may be an issue in the future with scheme names have their own 
    namespace - in which case, the Web form will have to be updated to ask for 
    it to be supplied.</p>
  <p> 3.3.1 The tokens must be unique. Every effort will be made to maintain the 
    short name proposed by the maintaining agency. In case of collisions, a suitable 
    alternative will be chosen in consultation with the maintaining agency.</p>
  <p> 3.3.3 Remove this para.</p>
  <p> 3.3.4 Add 'Other translations, if registered, will be assigned an alternative 
    name'.</p>
  <p> 3.4.1 Change sentence to read 'DCMI will register multiple versions of schemes&#133;'.</p>
  <p> 3.4.3 Correct spelling of abridged.</p>
  <p> Change Stu's wording of answer in FAQ to read 'Ideally, schemes will be 
    registered by the maintaining agency&#133;' (Tom to action this).</p>
  <p> Next meeting: Weds 12.00.</p>
  <p> <i><b>Meeting 3</b></i><br>
  </p>
  <p>Weds, 12.00<br>
  </p>
  <p>Present: Rachel, Harry, Roland, Traugott, Uramoto, Haruki, Michael, Stuart, 
    Diane, Andy</p>
  <p> <b>Arch WG issues</b></p>
  <p> Repeated elements - guidance needed. Usage is addressed in DCQ/RDF Recommendation.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Language of element values - addressed verbosely in DCQ/RDF recommendation. 
    Could be handled by xml:lang - should be raised with W3C thru arch WG - needs 
    raising with dc-ac.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Valid issues but should be raised thru the architecture WG.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Registry WG issues<br>
  </p>
  <p>Prototype registry available - need to transition into working registry service. 
    Few issues need to be resolved to do this.<br>
  </p>
  <p>1) Clarify the status/role/content of RDF Schemas which express the semantics 
    of DCMI terms.<br>
  </p>
  <p>2) Who approves RDF schemas?<br>
  </p>
  <p>Does the internal function of the registry depend on the RDF Schema?<br>
  </p>
  <p>Does registry have a role in UB workflow? The UB currently does not want 
    workflow managed thru the registry. Rachel suggested that use of registry 
    would be very helpful in managing workflow and in disseminating current status 
    of proposed terms. No real disagreement with this - but not seen as short 
    term requirement.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Content of the RDF Schema</b><br>
  </p>
  <p>Possible model for registry is to hold the master copy of the data in the 
    registry database and export views of that data as: simple RDFS, richer RDFS, 
    XML schemas and whatever else might be required in the future.<br>
  </p>
  <p>This approach would need tool for managing content in the database.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Diane to write up the final step in the process that makes changes to the 
    registry based on UB decisions.<br>
  </p>
