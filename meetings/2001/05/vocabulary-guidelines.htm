<H1>Guidelines for reviewing and acknowledging vocabulary and encoding scheme 
qualifiers</H1>Material for discussion 
<P></P>
<HR>

<UL>
  <LI>DCMI does not approve vocabulary and encoding schemes, but acknowledges 
  formally maintained schemes as suitable for use with DC metadata. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>A registry of vocabulary and encoding schemes might be established and 
  maintained by others (metadata registries; cf. the NKOS effort at <A 
  href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/</A>. The 
  information DCMI needs fits in the proposed NKOS scheme.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI>DCMI should try to agree with future maintainers of a vocabulary registry 
  on data elements and definitions which guarantee that DCMI and metadata design 
  needs are fulfilled. Vocabularies and encoding schemes registred there (if 
  necessary with a specific indicator) would be "automatically" acknowledged for 
  use in DC metadata. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>In the meantime DCMI needs to establish a public list of acknowledged 
  schemes. It might be appropriate to maintain separate lists for vocabulary 
  qualifiers to the Subject element and for encoding schemes for use in the 
  other elements. The Usage board creates the list proactively and adds to it on 
  request. Relevant parts of the MARC code lists and schemes used in known 
  metadata implementations are used to build an initial version. The public list 
  page features a submission form where everyone can ask for acknowledgment of a 
  scheme. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>For each scheme the list should provide the following information: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Name of the scheme 
    <LI>Label/acronym 
    <LI>URL for online access (if applicable) 
    <LI>URL (or physical address) to access information </LI></UL>
  <P></P>Ex.: Dewey Decimal Classification | DDC | <A 
  href="http://purl.oclc.org/corc/">Web Dewey in CORC</A> | <A 
  href="http://www.oclc.org/fp/">http://www.oclc.org/fp/</A> |
  <P></P>Ex.: Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names | TGN | <A 
  href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/index.html">http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/index.html</A> 
  | - | 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Rules about what kind of schemes will be acknowledged 
  <UL>
    <LI>Schemes created and maintained by trusted authorities and properly 
    published are acknowledged and listed. 
    <LI>Only schemes with a decently sized user base at national or broader 
    level should be listed 
    <LI>The DC qualifier document and user guidelines should state, that the 
    listed qualifiers are only appropiate for an unchanged use of an official 
    version of the scheme. Unofficial versions, modified versions, unofficial 
    translations and similar should not use the official label but apply a local 
    name (e.g. service, project or provider name. Ex.: DutchESS or DutchESS-BC 
    if it is really close). 
    <LI>An unaltered subset of an official scheme does not need to be indicated 
    or named differently. </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Rules about the naming of the schemes 
  <UL>
    <LI>Schemes should be named with their official names </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Rules about the acronyms used as DCMI qualifier labels (?) 
  <UL>
    <LI>Existing official acronyms or short names should be used as labels. 
    <LI>In case communication with the scheme owner does not result in an agreed 
    label, the Usage Board creates and lists a suitable label. 
    <LI>Official translated versions receive a label where a standard language 
    code is added, e.g. DDC-fr. This is necessary since translated versions are 
    rarely fully equivalent. </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Rules about the specification of scheme versions 
  <UL>
    <LI>The DCMI list does not register versions of the schemes 
    <LI>Users should be encouraged to indicate the official version of the 
    scheme used, e.g. DDC21, DDC21ab-fr, MSC2000 </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The Usage board acknowledges schemes after applying above rules by 
  including them into the public list. That is the confirmation that they are 
  appropriate for use in DC metadata. </LI></UL>
