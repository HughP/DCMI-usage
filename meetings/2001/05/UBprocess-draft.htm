    <LI>4.4. Criteria for acceptance of proposals 
    <UL>
      <LI>4.4.1. Follows existing principles of qualification 
      <LI>4.4.2. Is well-formed 
      <LI>4.4.3. Does not conflict with or create ambiguity with regard to 
      existing elements, or qualifiers 
      <LI>4.4.4. Does not needlessly create problems for existing legacy 
      implementations <FONT color=red>["Needlessly" is vague and undefined 
      --RG]</FONT> 
      <LI><FONT color=green><I>4.4.5. Qualifies as an interoperability solution 
      with cross-domain application</I></FONT> </LI></UL>
    <LI>4.5. Categories of acceptance (using Tom's definitions) 
    <UL>
      <LI>4.5.1. CONFORMING. Proposed terms judged by the Usage Committee to 
      substantially meet grammatical principles. <FONT color=red>[Use of "terms" 
      unclear. Do we mean qualifiers or elements? --RG]</FONT> 
      <LI>4.5.2. NON-CONFORMING. Proposed terms found not to be in conformance 
      with principles, if the Usage Committee wishes to state this for the 
      record. Perhaps the registry would model this as an assertion about a term 
      located in a non-DCMI namespace. In most cases, however, a verdict would 
      simply be returned to the proposer with comments or a recommendation to 
      revise and resubmit. 
      <LI>4.5.3. RECOMMENDED. Conforming terms shown to be of general use and 
      broad interest across disciplines. The Usage Committee may want to 
      recommend that multiple Conforming terms of similar scope be combined into 
      one single Recommended term. <FONT color=red>[What about conforming (to 
      principles) but not recommended (i.e. not of general use)? --RB]</FONT> 
      <LI>4.5.4. OBSOLETE. For terms that have been superseded, deprecated, or 
      rendered obsolete. Such terms will remain in the registry for use in 
      interpreting legacy metadata. </LI></UL>
    <LI>4.6. Voting 
    <UL>
      <LI>4.6.1. Voting shall be limited to scheduled meetings <FONT 
      color=red>[Is there any chance of approving through an email ballot 
      non-controversial qualifiers, e.g. the registration of a new encoding 
      scheme? Or doing a conference call? --RG]</FONT> 
      <LI>4.6.2. Voting shall be limited to UB members present at the meeting 
      and able to participate in the discussion 
      <LI>4.6.3. UB members who cannot be present may present their arguments 
      for or against a proposal in writing prior to a meeting (this shall not 
      constitute a vote) 
      <LI>4.6.4. UB members who cannot be present may explore other options with 
      the chair, such as conference calling, etc. if they cannot be present for 
      an important vote. In all cases, a vote may not be cast by a member who is 
      not present, either actually or virtually, for the relevant discussion 
      <FONT color=red>[What if there's a tie? --RG] [Perhaps 2/3 majority is too 
      low a threshold? --TB]</FONT> </LI></UL></LI></UL>

      <LI>5.2.2 Public discussions of UB related issues should take place in the

      if necessary be cc:ed to the internal UB list.

      <LI>5.3.1 Important documents like UB membership, meeting agendas, meeting 
      minutes, proposals to the UB, voting or decision documents and results (if 
      not part of minutes) and similar are archived as separate documents in an 
      area of the DCMI web site devoted to the UB. It could be structured 
      similarily as a working group page with an issues, forums and resources 
      section. If necessary, an UB internal section can be password protected. 
      <LI>5.3.2 Historic documents relevant to the UB work, like voting 
      proposals and results from the first DC Qualifier voting are to be 
      gathered and archived at the same page (background). 
      <LI>5.3.3 Results of the UB work which take the form of official DCMI 
      documents (working drafts, proposed recommendations and recommendations) 
      are made available and archived at: http://www.dublincore.org/documents/ 
      as all the other similar documents. This includes upcoming lists of 
      acknowledged vocabulary and encoding scheme qualifiers. 
      <LI>5.3.4 The UB page maintains links to upcoming external relevant 
      metadata, vocabulary and encoding scheme registries.
