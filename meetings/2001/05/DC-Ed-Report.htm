  <P>In August 1999, the Dublin Core Advisory Committee (DCAC) formed the 
  DC-Education Working Group (DC-Ed WG) with the charge “to discuss and develop 
  a proposal for the use of Dublin Core metadata in the description of 
  educational resources. The scope includes educational resources applicable for 
  many national education communities and cross-sectoral communities (e.g., 
  K-12, further and higher education and lifelong learning).” Jon Mason of 
  Education Network Australia (EdNA) and Stuart Sutton of the Gateway to 
  Educational Materials (GEM) projects were named co-chairs of the WG. DC-Ed WG 
  discussions began immediately on the listserv in preparation for the 
  birds-of-a-feather (BOF) meeting in Frankfurt in October 1999.</P>
  <P>At the Frankfurt meeting, the DC-Ed WG BOF delineated five information 
  areas of particular interest to existing DC-based educational metadata 
  projects:</P>
  <OL>
    <LI>“<STRONG>Users:</STRONG> 
    <UL>
      <LI>Grade, age, academic/vocational/training ‘level’ 
      <LI>Administrators of the resource 
      <LI>Student ‘audience’ (‘target group,’ ‘learning context,’ ‘beneficiary’) 
      </LI></UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Duration:</STRONG> 
    <UL>
      <LI>Focus on ‘use’ time (as opposed to technical duration) </LI></UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Learning Processes/Characteristics:</STRONG> 
    <UL>
      <LI>Student groupings, teaching methods, mechanisms of assessment, 
      learning prerequisites, interactivity type and level, material type from a 
      didactic viewpoint, type of use in a scholastic milieu, ‘difficulty’, 
      ‘semantic density,’ etc. </LI></UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Standards:</STRONG> 
    <UL>
      <LI>National and/or international curricula 
      <LI>National and/or international content/process standards 
      <LI>Domain specific standards and benchmarks (e.g., U.S. Departments of 
      Labor &amp; Defense training benchmarks, etc.) </LI></UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Quality:</STRONG> 
    <UL>
      <LI>Unstructured assessments (e.g., third-party reviews/annotations) 
      <LI>Structured assessments (assessment based on established evaluative 
      criteria)” </LI></UL></LI></OL>
  <P>These five general categories (some more than others) were the principle 
  drivers of subsequent listserv discussions as well as in the development of 
  strawman proposals going into the WG’s face-to-face meeting at Kattemingga 
  Lodge outside Melbourne on February 19-20, 2000. The DC-Ed WG discussion 
  summaries and strawman proposals going into the face-to-face meeting in 
  Melbourne can be found at <A 
  href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dc-ed/disc_summ.html">http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dc-ed/disc_summ.html</A>.</P>
  <P>The minutes of the Melbourne face-to-face meeting can be found at <A 
  href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/DC7_DCEd.html">http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/DC7_DCEd.html</A>. 
  These minutes were distributed to the face-to-face meeting participants for 
  review and revision from March 1, 2000 through March 7, 2000. On March 7, 
  2000, the amended minutes were distributed for comment to the full DCEd WG on 
  the DC-Education listserv. On April 15, 2000, the minutes were distributed to 
  DC-General. With this document, the DC-Education WG completes its preliminary 
  charge by submitting its proposal to the DCAC.</P>
  <P>In addition to memorializing the DCEd WG’s proposal to the DCAC, this 
  document outlines both existing issues regarding which the WG could not bring 
  closure, and areas where it has defined needs for future work.</P>Jon

  <P>In assessing each of the five categories of educational information that 
  were defined in Frankfurt and discussed to varying degrees on the DC-Education 
  listserv, the following questions were used at the face-to-face meeting to 
  guide assessment of each category:</P>
  <OL>
    <LI><STRONG>Can “it” be clearly described?</STRONG> Can the semantics of the 
    proposed element or element qualifier be expressed precisely, unambiguously, 
    and briefly?
    <P></P>
    <LI><STRONG>Is there a clear requirement for “it” in support of resource 
    discovery in the education domain?</STRONG> Is there a <EM>demonstrated</EM> 
    need for the proposed element, element qualifier, or value qualifier?
    <P></P>
    <LI><STRONG>Does “it” support interoperability?</STRONG> Does it, to the 
    maximum extent possible, support interoperability.
    <P></P>
    <LI><STRONG>Is “it” practical?</STRONG> How difficult would it be for people 
    creating metadata to comprehend the semantics of the proposed element or 
    element qualifier and to apply it reasonably in the description of 
resources.
    <P></P>
    <LI><STRONG>Does “it” refine an existing element?</STRONG> If “it” is a 
    proposal for a new element, can it rationally be handled <EM>as 
    effectively</EM> as an element or value qualifier for an existing element?
    <P></P>
    <LI><STRONG>Are there alternative ways of implementing “it”?</STRONG> Within 
    the conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set (i.e., 
    element/element qualifiers and value/value qualifiers), are there 
    alternative ways to achieve the ends sought?
    <P></P>
    <LI><STRONG>Are there existing implementations or controlled vocabularies, 
    etc., supporting “it”?</STRONG> Somewhat akin to number 2 above, are there 
    existing implementations for which this solution (element or element 
    qualifier or value qualifier) is needed in support of resource discovery. In 
    similar fashion, are there existing value qualifiers (i.e., controlled 
    vocabularies, thesauri, etc.) that support “it”.

  <P>In the work at Kattemingga, it was important for the participants to 
  distinguish among the following classes of metadata elements (in descending 
  order of interoperability):</P>
  <OL>
    <LI><STRONG>DC-Interoperability Elements/Qualifiers:</STRONG> Entities that 
    are judged to be widely useful across disciplines–i.e., they are Core 
    entities. 
    <LI><STRONG>DC-Domain Elements/Qualifiers:</STRONG> Entities that are judged 
    to be useful within a domain, but perhaps not across domains. 
    <LI><STRONG>Common, But Local Elements/Qualifiers:</STRONG> Entities that 
    are intended to be useful for local applications or in a constrained 
    federation of applications, but, perhaps, not widely used even in a given 
    domain. </LI></OL>

  <P>It was unanimously agreed among members of the Working Group at the 
  face-to-face meeting that the capacity to designate various aspects of the 
  intended users of an educational resource being described is an important 
  function for networked information discovery and retrieval. Frequently, 
  creators and publishers of resources explicitly state the type (class, 
  category, target) of user for whom the resource is intended (designed, 
  appropriate).</P>
  <P>In the original discussions on the DC-Education list, it was generally 
  agreed that there are two classes of audience necessary to the 
  education/training domain. These two classes are related and include, in the 
  first instance, those persons, organizations, and other forms of entities that 
  administor or mediate access to the resource by the second class of 
  audience–the “end” users for whose benefit the resource being described was 
  designed–i.e., the ultimate beneficiaries.</P>
  <P>At the face-to-face meeting, there was considerable discussion both in the 
  breakout group looking at the audience proposal and in the subsequent full 
  group session regarding the need for the qualifiers put forward in the 
  original strawman proposal–i.e., the strawman “intermediary” and “beneficiary” 
  qualifiers. There was some diversity of opinion with how best to proceed with 
  qualifiers. As the table below denotes, it was generally (although not 
  unanimously) agreed that there were instances where refinement of the proposed 
  audience element is necessary. However, the breakout group and the generally 
  agreed upon draft proposal changed the name of the strawman qualifier 
  “intermediary” to “mediator” and dropped the proposed “beneficiary” qualifier 
  in the strawman proposal brought to Kattemingga.</P>
  <P>Two different implementations achieving the goal were identified and are 
  set out below. Both implementations share the same justifications.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> It was noted by the face-to-face participants that a 
  general (unqualified) audience element might be useful in domains beyond 
  education.</P><A name=audience1></A>

      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Web-based searches for educational resources are often 
      framed in terms of the particular people for whom those resources are 
      intended; e.g., research has shown that teachers frequently search for 
      resources by grade level (research performed by the Gateway to Educational 
      Materials project (GEM) based on content analysis of the AskERIC archives 
      and survey research of end-users).</P>
      <P>Is there a clear requirement for the element qualifier 
      (“mediator”)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The element refinement is 
      required for many resources in order to distinguish between the primary 
      audience (i.e., the ultimate beneficiary–usually a student or trainee) and 
      a secondary audience that mediates access to the resource by the primary 
      audience (i.e., usually a teacher or trainer).</P>

    <STRONG>Does “it” support interoperability?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to promote interoperability widely, 
      it will be useful to identify a common vocabulary of audience descriptors. 
      The basis for such a vocabulary (or vocabularies) may be derived through 
      analysis of: (1) existing vocabularies in current use in education-based 
      applications; (2) existing education-specific audience descriptors in 
      thesauri (e.g., the <EM>Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors</EM>); and (3) in 
      the emerging IEEE Learning Object Metadata standard specification. The 
      definition of such a vocabulary (or vocabularies) would be an appropriate 
      task of the DC-Education Working Group.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><LI>
    <STRONG>Is “it” practical?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Current experience by existing projects in capturing 
      audience information demonstrates that it is not difficult. This is 
      particularly the case where the resource being described has been 
      <U>expressly</U> intended or designed for a particular 
    audience.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><LI>
    <STRONG>Does “it” refine an existing element?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>No.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been discussions elsewhere (e.g., the 
      Description Working Group) regarding audience as an element qualifier for 
      one of the existing DCES. It appears that a general consensus exists that 
      audience should not qualify an existing element.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><LI>
    <STRONG>Are there alternative ways of implementing “it”?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>No.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working Group members at the face-to-face meeting could 
      think of no ways of achieving the goal except via a new audience 
      element.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><LI>
    <STRONG>Are there existing implementations or controlled vocabularies, etc., 
    supporting “it”?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Network Australia (EdNA) is in the process of 
      implementing its vocabulary; GEM has an existing vocabulary as well as a 
      repository of resources cataloged using audience characterisics; the IEEE 
      LOM contains elements reaching some aspects of audience (which means that 
      the GESTALT, ARIADNE, and IMS projects all provide for audience 
      information); and, various education-specific thesauri contain audience 
      classification descriptors (e.g., the <EM>Thesaurus of ERIC 
      Descriptors</EM> and the <EM>NICEM Thesaurus</EM>, to name but a 
    few).</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL>

    <P>
    <LI>The solution needs a mechanism for the “relation” element to 
    unambiguously “point” to discrete locations deeply embedded in a standards 
    document (a pointer to a textual representation is simple; a pointer to a 
    digitally available instantiation is not so simple).

    to execute a search directly using a reference to a standard. But that is 
    not possible now.

    <LI>Human users will want to search for resources associated with specific 
    standards. But in the future, machines will be collecting the information 
    for further synthesis. But this is not close enough to be useful for us now.

    <STRONG>Is there a clear requirement for “it” in support of resource discovery

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, educational resources are either being 
      designed to meet the needs of specific content and process standards, or 
      are being associated with such standards after creation. Being able to 
      search for resources that meet the goals of specific standards is growing 
      in importance as more educational processes become standards-based.</P>

        that support the Texas Essential Skills for 4<SUP>th</SUP> grade 
        science. 
        <LI>A math teacher is looking for resources that conform to the National 
        Council of the Teachers of Math (NCTM) standards for teaching 
        8<SUP>th</SUP> grade algebra.

    <STRONG>Does “it” support interoperability?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;With registries/repositories for content and process 
      standards, varying degrees of interoperability can be achieved. For 
      example, in the United States, an organization named “Achieve” (formed 
      through the efforts of U.S. state governors) has cross-mapped content 
      standards for over forty states in order to achieve a level of 
      “interoperability” among resources associated with those 
    standards.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><LI>
    <STRONG>Is “it” practical?</strong> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many educational departments at all levels of 
      government wanting to support standards within their jurisdictions will 
      mandate the association of resources to their standards. Many commercial 
      providers and other content creators wanting to make their resources easy 
      to find it, will associate those resources with one (or more) recognized 
      standards.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><LI>

  <P>It is generally agreed among members of the Working Group at Frankfurt that 
  the capacity to designate various kinds of activities of students, and various 
  kinds of methods used by teachers/trainers in the teaching/learning process is 
  important for networked information discovery and retrieval. However, as 
  chronicled in the section below on open issues, the Working Group members at 
  the face-to-face meeting were unable to resolve issues regarding this category 
  resulting in the decision to make no general recommentations at this time 
  regarding the creation of either a new education-focused element (and possible 
  element qualifiers for such an element ) or element qualifiers for the 
  existing DCES.</P>
  <P>However, in conformance with the DCMI commitment to modular metadata, the 
  Working Group members at the face-to-face meeting unanimously recommend the 
  use of the “InteractivityType” and the “InteractivityLevel” data elements 
  (Education Category: 5.1 &amp; 5.3) from the IEEE Learning Object Metadata 
  (LOM) draft standard for P1484.12. These two data elements partially fulfill 
  needs identified under the Teaching Processes/Characteristics category at 
  Frankfurt. Representatives from DCMI and IMS/IEEE (IMS is as an instantiation 
  of the IEEE LOM and was represented at the face-to-face meeting) will identify 
  an appropriate technical means to enable referencing the namespace. It was 
  recognized that mixing of namespaces raises important issues of 
  interoperability among metadata registries–issues that will be explored by 
  DCMI and IMS/IEEE.</P>
  <P>The table below represents the IEEE P1484.12 data elements 5.1 &amp; 5.3 as 
  set forth in the recently released (5 February 2000) <A

  <P>It is generally agreed among members of the Working Group at the 
  face-to-face meeting that the capacity to designate the “use time” for the 
  resource being described is an important attribute in networked information 
  discovery and retrieval. This category of information was called “duration” at 
  the Frankfurt meeting. The concept of “duration” is distinct from the physical 
  size of the resource or its potential technical “run time” (where such 
  exists). Values for this category represent the approximate or typical time it 
  takes to work with the resource.</P>
  <P>In conformance with the DCMI commitment to modular metadata, the Working 
  Group members at the face-to-face meeting unanimously recommend the use of the 
  “TypicalLearningTime” data element (Education Category: 5.9) from the IEEE 
  Learning Object Metadata (LOM) draft standard for P1484.12 to represent the DC 
  “duration” concept. Representatives from DCMI and IMS/IEEE (IMS is as an 
  instantiation of the IEEE LOM and was represented at the face-to-face meeting) 
  will identify an appropriate technical means to enable referencing the 
  namespace. It was recognized that mixing of namespaces raises important issues 
  of interoperability among metadata registries–issues that will be explored by 
  DCMI and IMS/IEEE.</P>
  <P>The table below represents the IEEE P1484.12–5.9 as set forth in the 
  recently released (5 February 2000) <A href="http://ltsc.ieee.org/wg12">Draft 
  4.0</A>.</P>

  <P>Through the work at Frankfurt, it was generally agreed among members of the 
  Working Group that the capacity to designate various aspects of the quality of 
  the educational resource being described is an important function for 
  networked information discovery and retrieval for a number of existing 
  projects. However, it was subsequently agreed at the face-to-face meeting in 
  Australia that no formal recommendation regarding the quality category should 
  be put forward at this time. It was suggested that education-related metadata 
  projects needing to express either a quality assessment within the descriptive 
  metadata for a resource or to establish a pointer to such an assessment 
  external to the descriptive metadata, should do so by means of a ‘local 
  element’ or a ‘local qualifier’ of the RELATION element–either alternative 
  being made available to the Dublin Core education community through the 
  emerging registry. </P>

  <P>There was general agreement at Kattemingga that the proposed DC.Type 
  vocabulary (DCT1–just balloted) is inadequate to meet the need for domain 
  specificity while still maintaining the maximum degree of interoperability. It 
  was proposed that an interested group of participants collate an extensive 
  list of education-focused resource types either currently in use or under 
  development. Subsequent efforts will destill an acceptable minimum set of 
  potential interoperability values from the larger listing. Representatives 
  from a group of projects subsequently collated a listing of education resource 
  types and made the listing available through the DC-Education listserv. 
  Discussions of the collated list are ongoing.</P>

  <P>Discussion within both the breakout session and the whole Working Group at 
  Kattemingga on <EM>Learning &amp; Teaching Processes/Characteristics</EM> was 
  lively and began with a classification into two broad classes – 
  <STRONG>activities</STRONG> and <STRONG>methods</STRONG>. Of these two broad 
  classifiers methods was clearly identified as the most contentious area for 
  debate. However, the practical constraints of the agreed evaluation criteria 
  resulted in the Working Group not pursuing developing a recommendation for a 
  DC-Education metadata element or “interoperability qualifier” at this stage. 
  While there appears to be a strong requirement from users that capturing and 
  accommodating “educational” metadata is necessary, the lack of any universally 
  accepted taxonomies in this area is the major issue. Also very much at issue – 
  and a topic which attracted a fair amount of debate – is where the boundary 
  between <STRONG>resources </STRONG>on the one hand, and the 
  <STRONG>processes</STRONG> which might operate on them on the other, is most 
  meaningfully drawn. Such a question was considered to be more than a 
  philosophical question where digital objects purposed for educational activity 
  is concerned.</P>
  <P>At the Frankfurt meeting the actual category identified was summarised as 
  “<EM>Learning Processes/Characteristics</EM>”. Since that time, discussion on 
  the DC-Education listserv and at Kattemingga was extended to be more inclusive 
  of “teaching”, with “pedagogy” receiving most attention. Thus, members of the 
  Working Group agreed that <EM>educational practice</EM> is more than the 
  assembly or packaging of resources. Moreover, any “assembly and packaging of 
  resources” if describable is potentially a valuable resource in itself for 
  discovery which may provide a better understanding of learning and teaching 
  practice. Related to this issue a further question was raised as to whether 
  there is a privileging of “learning objects” in currently implemented schema 
  whereby notions of “education” tend to reduce to “resource-based 
learning”.</P>
  <P>The bottom line group consensus was that <EM>Learning &amp; Teaching 
  Processes / Characteristics</EM> is an important but complex area that 
  includes value statements and many overlapping vocabularies based on ideology 
  or local frameworks. </P>
  <P>The Working Group agreed that in order to make further progress on this 
  issue, a research proposal be suitably framed.</P>

  <P>In Frankfurt, October 1999, the DC-Education Working Group identified 
  <EM>Learning Processes/Characteristics</EM> as one of five categories which 
  could classify the kinds of approaches that various educational metadata 
  projects already implemented had pursued. The five categories were based upon 
  two independent analyses and first proposed by Stuart Sutton. The categories 
  were proposed as a representative and broadly inclusive rough cut 
  classification for “educational metadata”.</P>
  <P>In Kattemingga, the category was broadened to <EM>Learning and Teaching 
  Processes / Characteristics</EM>. This was in response to discussion which had 
  largely taken place on the mailbase list where “pedagogy” had occupied most 
  attention.</P>
  <P>However, based on the evaluation criteria for determining interoperability, 
  members of the Working Group present at the Kattemingga workshop were unable 
  to make a recommendation concerning possible new elements and qualifiers which 
  could be seriously considered by the wider DC-Education community or the 
  DC-Advisory Committee. Nonetheless, it was unanimous that developing a 
  well-framed research proposal may be a practical strategy to take the issue(s) 
  forward.</P>
  <P>Thus, the Working Group agreed to: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Define suitable research project(s) to remove impediments to useful 
    implementations of metadata which does or could capture <EM>Learning and 
    Teaching Processes / Characteristics</EM>; and 
    <LI>Identify suitable sources of funding. </LI></UL>
  <P>In framing the project, the following actions from members of the 
  DC-Education Working Group were considered to be important: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Identifying and/or recommending appropriate controlled vocabularies; 
    <LI>Accurately scoping user requirements with regard to the activities and 
    methods associated with teaching and learning; and 
    <LI>Obtaining real feedback, based upon empirical data where possible, in 
    terms of existing usage and user requirements. </LI></UL>

  <P>Part of the discussions on the DC-Education listserv since the face-to-face 
  meeting in Melbourne have focused on the need to identify the “level” of the 
  students/trainees for which the resource being described is intended. This 
  notion of level might be expressed in a number of ways depending on the 
  context but appears to include information such as grade level, course level, 
  and perhaps age group. In listserv discussions prior to the Melbourne meeting, 
  this aspect of a resource was part of the proposed “Audience” element. See, 
  for example, the discussion summary (<A 
  href="http://u.washington.edu/sasutton/dc-ed/Audience_SS_1.html">Category: 
  Audience</A>) leading into face-to-face meeting.</P>
  <P>While there appears to be general agreement regarding the need to capture 
  this aspect of a resource for effective networked information discovery and 
  retrieval, questions have arisen regarding whether the information 
  appropriately belongs as part of the proposed “Audience” element (perhaps as 
  an element qualifier) <STRONG>or</STRONG> as a separate DC-Education 
  element.</P>
  <P>Since the time-frame was too short for the DC-Education Working Group to 
  discuss and resolve the issues before this submission to the Advisory 
  Committee for review, the general agreement regarding a need to more precisely 
  identify this aspect of an educational resource demands that discussions be 
  ongoing. The Working Group will return to the Advisory Committee with a 
  proposal at a later date.
