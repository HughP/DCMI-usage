TOPIC 06. RDF schemas of DCMI terms (Roland/Makx/Tom)

   Tom, Roland, Eric, Dave Beckett, Makx, and Stu held a
   round of discussions earlier this year with the goal of
   resolving modeling issues for declaring DCMI terms in
   RDF schemas.  Makx, Tom, and Roland will report on the
   status of these discussions and on future paths forward.
   We will discuss the role of the Usage Board as compared
   with DC-Architecture and other groups within DCMI with
   regard to the schemas.
