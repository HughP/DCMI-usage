TOPIC 15. Dublin Core Application Profiles (Tom)

    Tom, Makx, Rachel, and Thomas Fischer have drafted
    Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles.  Based on
    an analysis of over twenty existing application profiles
    of Dublin Core, the draft guidelines aim at providing
    a sensible and coherent format that will meet the needs
    of most Application Profile creators; that is as simple
    as possible yet as detailed as is sometimes necessary;
    and that will lend itself in the future to transformation
    into machine-processable forms.  Should the Usage Board
    approve of, promote, or use these guidelines?  Would the 
    Usage Board need to discuss these guidelines in detail?

    Required reading:

== May need to add to DCMI Usage Board Review guidelines:

    General recommendation: an application profile cannot be
    conforming unless:
    --      it uses elements and qualifiers in line with DCMI
            grammar,
    --      it only uses particular qualifiers in line with
            existing DCMI term declarations (e.g. you cannot
            currently use URI as an encoding scheme for
            dc:description).
