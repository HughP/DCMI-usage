Title:       Miscellaneous issues for possible consideration in future
Date:        2003-06-11
Description: This is the file where I simply "dump" issues which (at
             the time of dumping) seem like they may some day need to
             be addressed.

==  Naming for Element Refinements.  Now that we use
    stand-alone names for Element Refinements, we have an
    awkward legacy of eight Element Refinement names that
    do not stand well on their own -- alternative, created,
    valid, available, issued, modified, spatial, and temporal.
    We decided at the Bath meeting to leave them alone for now
    and to switch to using stand-alone names in the future.
    However, we could consider whether to create a redundant
    set of names (e.g., dcq:alternativeTitle) with equivalency
    relationships to the existing names.  If we were to
    do so, this move would need to be accompanied by an
    "environmental impact" analysis pointing out practical
    implications for implementors and for DCMI-maintained
    implementation recommendations (DC-in-RDF, DC-in-HTML,
    etc).  We would also need to evaluate whether HTML
    guidelines should be modified to use Element Refinements
    in a stand-alone manner, as is currently recommended for
    XML usage (e.g.  meta name="DCQ.created" scheme="W3CDTF"
    content="2001-06-15").  Alternatively, and perhaps
    more easily, we might consider merely changing the
    human-readable labels (e.g., "Alternative Title").

==  Definition of dc:title. The definition of "title" should
    be reworded to eliminate an inherent assumption that a
    resource must have a well-defined, unique, formal title.
    (Roland, Oct 2001)

==  Qualification of dc:format.  As proposed in 1999, the
    Format qualifier "medium" is only applicable to physical
    resources and "IMT" is only applicable to virtual
    resources.  Do we need to revise the official definitions
    to clarify something like the following?  (Andy, Feb 25
    2002) :
    1) genre - the representational class of the resource
       (DC.Type)
    2) medium - the physical carrier of the information
       (DC.Format/medium)
    3) encoding - the way in which the data is encoded on the
       medium (DC.Format/IMT)

==  RDDL Core.  RDDL in effect defines its own core element
    set for resource discovery -- one that overlaps in awkward
    ways with Dublin Core.  See <a href="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/">http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/</a>
    and <a href="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/rddl.rdfs">http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/rddl.rdfs</a>.  Is this
    a problem? (Oct 2001).

==  Use of Dublin Core for non-DLO resources.  Is it acceptable
    to use DC metadata to describe non-DLOs (such as people,
    organisations, museum artefacts, events, hurricanes,
    species)?  Or: does DCMI want to say that it is *not*
    acceptable to describe these kinds of things using DC
    metadata?  (Andy, Jan 2002; Liddy Nevile in Dec 2002)
    Diane thinks it's useful to have a consensus on this, but we
    might want to have someone write a discussion starter couple
    of pages on this before we meet; there's a lot of history
    to this one.

==  DCMI Type Vocabulary and Dublin Core scope.  If DCMI
    wants to say that it is *not* acceptable to describe
    non-DLOs using DC metadata, do we need to indicate
    somehwere that the current DCMI Type list is _not_ intended
    to be an exhaustive list of the kinds of resources that DC
    can be used to describe?  To what extent is the current
    list of types in the DCMIType list an exhaustive list
    of the kinds of resources that can be described using
    DC metadata?  (Andy, Jan 2002)

==  Guidelines on using Dublin Core for non-DLO resources.
    If it is acceptable to describe non-DLOs using DC metadata,
    does DCMI want to provide any best-practice guidelines for
    how to do it in specific instances, such as for people?
    If so, what DCMI WGs would do this? (Andy, Jan 2002)

==  Encoding commonly used identifiers as URIs. Andy has
    drafted some guidelines about encoding various
    commonly used identifiers as URIs in DC metadata.
    See <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-identifiers/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-identifiers/</a>

==  Encoding schemes for dc:relation and dc:source.  Should all
    encoding schemes for Identifier hold also for Relation and
    Source?  Do we need to capture this in our documentation?
    Diane thinks we should first agree whether we want to do
    something similar to the creator/contributor thing as a
    precursor to considering this question.

==  Encoding scheme "URI" for Description and Rights (Rebecca,
    Oct 12 2001)

==  Guidelines on using URIs as values.  For example,
    in Identifier, Relation and Source, the use of 'URI' as an
    encoding scheme means "here is the value and it is a URI".
    In Rights and Description, the use of 'URI' as an encoding
    scheme would mean "the value can be found at the following
    URI".  These two things are not the same and therefore
    shouldn't be encoded using the same mechanism.  (Andy,
    Oct 14 2001).  This issue was discussed in Florence, where
    it was not really resolved, though for this particular
    case it was noted that URI had never been voted on as an
    encoding scheme for dc:description and that therefore
    it is not currently permissible to use it in this way.
    Do we need to cover this issue in our documentation?

==  Best practice for dc:date. The "best practice" with date
    doesn't fit with the "best practice" of the Qualifiers
    recommendation (Roland, Oct 2002)

==  Scope of dc:language.  Language should not be restricted
    to natural languages.  Languages in the sense of computer
    science can carry intellectual content, but the "best
    practice" assertion seems to exclude that (Roland,
    Oct 2002).

==  Comment for dc:subject.  The Comment for dc:subject could
    be read as condoning usage such as
    "&lt;dc:subject&gt;252&lt;/dc:subject&gt;".  Roland strongly disagrees
    with this and thinks it needs clarification (Roland,
    Oct 2002).  The comment currently reads:

       Typically, a Subject will be expressed as keywords,
       key phrases or classification codes that describe
       a topic of the resource.  Recommended best practice
       is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary or
       formal classification scheme.

==  Applicability of encoding schemes to Element
    Refinements. According to the term declaration, W3CDTF and
    Period only apply to Date, not any of the Date refinements.
    Should they apply to Date AND all its refinements (both
    recommended and conforming)?  Diane points out that this 
    is really the same question as in Source and Relation.

==  Capturing informal usage advice. In response to a question
    from Chris Croome on 7 August, there were
    helpful postings from Andy Powell and Jon Hanna,
    after which Chris asked whether we have any way to
    capture and make available clarifications of this kind.
    <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0208&L=dc-general&T=0&O=A&P=2886">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0208&L=dc-general&T=0&O=A&P=2886</a>
    Where could we put such information?  How would this
    relate to the User Guide activity?  AskDCMI is a recent
    and very relevant development in this regard.

==  2002-11-05: Relationship between
    <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0211&L=dc-usage&T=0&F=&S=&P=54">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0211&L=dc-usage&T=0&F=&S=&P=54</a>
    btw dc:contributor/1.0 and dc:contributor/1.1

==  Should DCMI use the term 'application profile' to describe
    sub-sets of its vocabulary?  Arguments "contra": An
    application profile 'uses' standard terms in an optimised
    way for a particular application; there are an infinite
    variety of application profiles that could be constructed.
    DCMI has said it is not in the business of 'approving'
    an unlimited number of application profiles. DCMI
    recommendations need to advise on 'generic' use of DCMI
    terms.  Should we 'approve' particular application profiles
    which may well emerge in a fairly arbitrary way?  How will
    DCMI distinguish between application profiles it wants
    to consider in the approval process and those it does not??

==  2002-07-10: Element name case.  Directorate will soon
    issue a policy statement about this that will clarify
    recommendations about retaining element name case
    as specified in existing schemas (lower case initial
    characters).  This policy statement will need to be
    reflected in existing documents (notably, a change in the
    DCMI Namespace Policy document) and alerts to the issue
    should probably appear elsewhere (the RDF Specification,
    for example).  At such time as can be done, this [policy
    should be reflected in future revisions of basic semantic
    declarations (the RFCs, Z39.85, and future ISO documents).

==  The OASIS DocBook Candidate Release
    makes a point of being compatible with Dublin Core _1.0_:
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/docbook/docbook-4.2-CR1.html">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/docbook/docbook-4.2-CR1.html</a>.

==  DCMI Publication Policy
    <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/2001/07/03/publications/">http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/2001/07/03/publications/</a>
    This document was an attempt to restructure the DCMI Web
    site - we need to look at this in the context of Web site
    redesign. No action required at this moment.

==  Potential role of UB in oversight of schemas (RDF and XML
    encodings) used in the DCMI registry or published on the Web
    for use in Semantic Web applications.

==  In approving new term proposals, what weight should UB give
    to working-group process, buy-in, and proven implementation
    experience.  To what extent is UB in job of a
    priori/posteriori.  How strict?  If nobody complains, is
    that sufficient proof to the UB that there are no adverse
    effects?

==  On whose judgement and with whose approval can the UB revise
    and evolve its own process?  Currently, there is a
    placeholder in the process document (Stuart Dec 12 2001)

==  "Related to this, I know the IMT encoding scheme is only valid
    for the Format element and not the medium element refinement
    [1].  Do we have a similar issue with W3CDTF - the schema
    makes it valid only for Date and temporal, but not any of the
    Date element refinements (created, et. al.).  I guess this is
    a reflection of how the usage of W3CDTF is defined in the DC
    Terms documents.  Though, looking back at the DC Qualifiers
    document, it wasn't clear whether an encoding scheme valid
    for an element is also valid for its element refinements -
    as discussed [1] IMT isn't intended for use in medium but
    surely W3CDTF is intended for use in created, modified, etc.?

== Carol van Nuys of the Norwegian Nasjonalbiblioteket, copied
   to this message, is having trouble translating the comment
   for Alternative (Title), which reads: "This qualifier
   can include Title abbreviations as well as translations."
   She assumes that it is the *value* of the qualifier which
   can include Title abbreviations, but the wording is a
   bit imprecise and, to some people, seems to actually say
   something else.

== Status and documentation of DCMES 1.0 elements:
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop/ReportOutcomes/S6Group2.html">http://www.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop/ReportOutcomes/S6Group2.html</a>:
   Shows identifier as being <a href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title">http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title</a>,
   which does in fact resolve to DCMES 1.0 document.
   Also, the DCMI Metadata Terms document
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/</a> does not show
   1.0 terms (but neither did current-elements document).
   Term-History (not yet available) shows 1.1 elements replacing 1.0.
   Likewise, <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/1999/07/02/dces/">http://dublincore.org/documents/1999/07/02/dces/</a> "replaces"
   (actually supersedes) <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/1998/09/dces/">http://dublincore.org/documents/1998/09/dces/</a>.
