     INTRODUCTION</h3>

     <p><strong><a id="whatismetadata"
     name="whatismetadata"></a>1.1. What is Metadata?</strong></p>


<p>Metadata has been with us since the first librarian made a list of the items
   on a shelf of handwritten scrolls. The term "meta" comes from a 
Greek word that
   denotes &quot;alongside, with, after, next.&quot; More recent Latin 
and English
   usage would employ &quot;meta&quot; to denote something 
transcendental, or beyond
   nature. Metadata, then, can be thought of as data about other data. It is the
   Internet-age term for information that librarians traditionally have put into
   catalogs, and it most commonly refers to descriptive information 
about Web resources.
</p>

     <p>A metadata record consists of a set of attributes, or
     elements, necessary to describe the resource in question. For
     example, a metadata system common in libraries -- the library
     catalog -- contains a set of metadata records with elements
     that describe a book or other library item: author, title, date
     of creation or publication, subject coverage, and the call
     number specifying location of the item on the shelf.</p>

     <p>The linkage between a metadata record and the resource it
     describes may take one of two forms:</p>

     <ol>
       <li>elements may be contained in a record separate from the
       item, as in the case of the library's catalog record; or</li>

       <li>the metadata may be embedded in the resource itself.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>Examples of embedded metadata that is carried along with the
     resource itself include the Cataloging In Publication (CIP)
     data printed on the verso of a book's title page; or the TEI
     header in an electronic text. Many metadata standards in use
     today, including the Dublin Core standard, do not prescribe
     either type of linkage, leaving the decision to each particular
     implementation.</p>

     <p>Although the concept of metadata predates the Internet and
     the Web, worldwide interest in metadata standards and practices
     has exploded with the increase in electronic publishing and
     digital libraries, and the concomitant "information overload"
     resulting from vast quantities of undifferentiated digital data
     available online. Anyone who has attempted to find information
     online using one of today's popular Web search services has
     likely experienced the frustration of retrieving hundreds, if
     not thousands, of "hits" with limited ability to refine or make
     a more precise search. The wide scale adoption of descriptive
     standards and practices for electronic resources will improve
     retrieval of relevant resources from the "Internet commons." As
     noted by Weibel and Lagoze, two leaders in the field of
     metadata development:</p>

     <blockquote>

   <p>&quot;The association of standardized descriptive metadata with networked
     objects has the potential for substantially improving resource 
discovery capabilities
     by enabling field-based (e.g., author, title) searches, permitting indexing
     of non-textual objects, and allowing access to the surrogate content that
     is distinct from access to the content of the resource itself." (Weibel and
     Lagoze, 1997)</p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>It is this need for "standardized descriptive metadata" that
     the Dublin Core addresses.</p>

     <p><strong><a id="whatis" name="whatis"></a>1.2. What is the
     Dublin Core?</strong></p>


<p>The Dublin Core metadata standard is a simple yet effective element set for
   describing a wide range of networked resources. The Dublin Core 
standard comprises
   fifteen elements, the semantics of which have been established
   by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from 
librarianship,
   computer science, text encoding, the museum community, and other 
related fields
   of scholarship.</p>
<p>Another way to look at Dublin Core is as a &quot;small language for making
   a particular class of statements about resources&quot. In this 
language, there are
   two classes of terms--elements (nouns) and qualifiers 
(adjectives)--which can be arranged
   into a simple pattern of statements. The resources themselves are 
the implied subjects
   in this language. (For additional discussion of Dublin Core Grammar, see
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/">&quot;DCMI
   Grammatical Principles&quot;</a>) In the diverse world of the 
Internet, Dublin Core can be seen as
   a &quot;metadata pidgin for digital tourists&quot;: easily grasped, 
but not necessarily up to
   the task of expressing complex relationships or concepts.</p>


<p>The Dublin Core basic element set is outlined in <a
     href="#coreelements">Section 4</a>. Each element is optional and 
may be repeated.
   Each element also has a limited set of qualifiers or refinements, 
attributes that may be used
   to further refine (not extend) the meaning of the element. The 
Dublin Core Metadata
   Initiative (DCMI) has established standard ways to refine elements 
and encourage the use of
   encoding and vocabulary schemes.</a>. The full set of <a 
href="/usage/terms/dc/current-elements/">
   elements and element refinements</a> conforming to DCMI &quot;best 
practice&quot; is available,
   with a formal registry in process.</p>

<p>Three other Dublin Core principles bear mentioning here, as they 
are critical to understanding
how to think about the relationship of metadata to the underlying 
resources they describe.</p>

<blockquote>1. The One-to-One Principle. In general Dublin Core 
metadata describes one manifestation
or version of a resource, rather than assuming that manifestations 
stand in for one another.  For
instance, a jpeg image of the Mona Lisa has much in common with the 
original painting, but it is
not the same as the painting. As such the digital image should be 
described as itself, most
likely with the creator of the digital image as Creator or 
Contributor, rather than the painter
of the original Mona Lisa. The relationship between the metadata for 
the original and the
reproduction is part of the metadata description, and assists the 
user in determining whether he or
she needs to go to the Louvre for the original, or whether his/her 
need can be met by a reproduction.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The Dumb-down Principle.The qualification of Dublin 
Core properties is guided
by a rule known colloquially as the Dumb-Down Principle.  According 
to this rule, a client
should be able to ignore any qualifier and use the value as if it 
were unqualified.
While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining 
element value (minus the qualifier)
  must continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery. 
Qualification is therefore
  supposed only to refine, not extend the semantic scope of a 
property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Appropriate values.  Best practice for a particular 
element or qualifier may vary by
context, but in general an implementor cannot always predict that the 
interpreter of the metadata
will always be a machine.  This may impose certain constraints on how 
metadata is constructed, but
the requirement of usefulness for discovery should be kept in mind.

<p>Although the Dublin Core favors document-like objects (because traditional
   text resources are fairly well understood), DC metadata can be 
applied to other resources
   as well. Its suitability for use with particular non-document resources will
   depend to some extent on how closely their metadata resembles 
typical document
   metadata and also what purpose the metadata is intended to serve. 
(Implementors
   interested in using Dublin Core for diverse resources are 
encouraged to browse
   the <a href="/projects/">Dublin Core Projects pages</a> for ideas 
on using Dublin
   Core metadata for their resources.) </p>

     <p>Dublin Core has as its goals:</p>

     <p>Simplicity of creation and maintenance</p>

     <blockquote>
       <p>The Dublin Core element set has been kept as small and
       simple as possible to allow a non-specialist to create simple
       descriptive records for information resources easily and
       inexpensively, while providing for effective retrieval of
       those resources in the networked environment.</p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>Commonly understood semantics</p>

     <blockquote>
       <p>Discovery of information across the vast commons of the
       Internet is hindered by differences in terminology and
       descriptive practices from one field of knowledge to the
       next. The Dublin Core can help the &quot;digital tourist&quot; -- a
       non-specialist searcher -- find his or her way by supporting
       a common set of elements, the semantics of which are
       universally understood and supported. For example, scientists
       concerned with locating articles by a particular author, and
       art scholars interested in works by a particular artist, can
       agree on the importance of a &quot;creator&quot; element. Such
       convergence on a common, if slightly more generic, element
       set increases the visibility and accessibility of all
       resources, both within a given discipline and beyond.</p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>International scope</p>

     <blockquote>

   <p>The Dublin Core Element Set was originally developed in English, 
but versions
     are being created in <a href="/groups/languages/#related">many 
other languages</a>,
     including Finnish, Norwegian, Thai, Japanese, French, Portuguese, German,
     Greek, Indonesian, and Spanish. <a 
href="http://dublincore.org/groups/languages/">The DCMI
     Localization and Internationalization Special Interest Group</a> 
is coordinating efforts
     to link these versions in a distributed registry.</p>

       <p>Although the technical challenges of internationalization
       on the World Wide Web have not been directly addressed by the
       Dublin Core development community, the involvement of
       representatives from virtually every continent has ensured that
       the development of the standard considers the multilingual
       and multicultural nature of the electronic information
       universe.</p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>Extensibility</p>

     <blockquote>

   <p>While balancing the needs for simplicity in describing digital resources
     with the need for precise retrieval, Dublin Core developers have recognized
     the importance of providing a mechanism for extending the DC 
element set for
     additional resource discovery needs. It is expected that other communities
     of metadata experts will create and administer additional 
metadata sets, specialized to the needs
     of their communities. Metadata elements from these sets could be 
used in conjunction
     with Dublin Core metadata to meet the need for 
interoperabilbility. The DCMI Usage Board is
     presently working on a model for accomplishing this in the 
context of "application profiles."</p>

     <p>Rachel Heery and Manjula Patel, in their article
     <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue25/app-profiles/">&quot;Application 
profiles:
     mixing and matching metadata schemas&quot;</a> define an 
application profile as:</p>

     <blockquote>
     &quot; ... schemas which consist of data elements drawn from one 
or more namespaces, combined
     together by implementors, and optimised for a particular local 
application.&quot;</blockquote>

     <p>This model allows different communities to use the DC elements 
for core descriptive information,
     and allowing domain specific extensions which make sense within a 
more limited arena. </p>
     </blockquote>

     <p><strong><a id="purpose" name="purpose"></a>1.3. The Purpose
     and Scope of This Guide</strong></p>


<p>This document is intended to be an entry point for users of Dublin Core. For
   non-specialists, it will assist in creating simple descriptive records
   for information resources (for example, electronic documents, JPEG 
images, video
   clips). Specialists may find the document a useful point of reference to the
   documentation of Dublin Core, as it changes and grows.</p>

     <p>&quot;Using Dublin Core&quot; will show in a non-technical 
fashion how Dublin
     Core metadata may be used by anyone to make their material more
     accessible. It discusses the principles, structure and content of
     Dublin Core metadata elements, how to use them in composing a
     complete Dublin Core metadata record, as well as how to qualify
     elements to support use by a wide variety of communities.</p>

     <p>Another important goal of this document is to promote "best
     practices" for describing resources using the Dublin Core
     element set. The Dublin Core community recognizes that
     consistency in creating metadata is an important key to
     achieving optimal retrieval and intelligible display across
     disparate sources of descriptive records. Inconsistent metadata
     effectively hides desired records, resulting in uneven,
     unpredictable or incomplete search results.</p>

<p>As a general introduction, this document is necessarily brief, and 
cannot address all the
issues implementors may encounter while planning their use of 
metadata. Several avenues remain
for those who have additional questions beyond those addressed in 
this guide. </p>

<h3><a id="whichsyntax" name="whichsyntax"></a>2. Syntax Issues</h3>


<p>In this guide, we have chosen to represent Dublin Core examples in several
   different syntaxes, including: HTML (the Web's Hypertext Markup 
Language format),
   RDF/XML (the Resource Description Framework using eXtensable Markup Language)
   and in a generic form (Element="value"). HTML provides an easily understood
   format for demonstrating Dublin Core's underlying concepts, but more complex
   applications using qualification may find that using XML or RDF 
makes more sense.
   When considering an appropriate syntax, it is important to note that Dublin
   Core concepts are equally applicable to virtually any file format, as long as
   the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation both by search engines
   and by human beings.</p>

     <p><strong><a id="html" name="html"></a>2.1. HTML</strong></p>


<p>HTML can be used to express either simple or qualified Dublin 
Core, although there are
   limitations inherent in representing refinements in HTML. Specific 
instructions for expressing
   Dublin Core in HTML can be found in the following two DCMI documents: </p>

   <blockquote>1. <a 
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2731.txt">Encoding Dublin Core 
Metadata in
   HTML</a>
   2. <a 
href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dcq-html/">Expressing 
Qualified Dublin Core
   in HTML/XHTML meta elements</a> (in Working Draft)


<p><strong><a id="rdfxml" name="rdfxml"></a>2.2. RDF/XML</strong></p>


<p>RDF (Resource Description Framework) allows multiple metadata schemes to be
   read by humans as well as parsed by machines. It uses XML (EXtensible Markup
   Language) to express structure thereby allowing metadata 
communities to define
   the actual semantics. This decentralized approach recognizes that 
no one scheme
   is appropriate for all situations, and further that schemes need a 
linking mechanism
   independent of a central authority to aid description, 
identification, understanding,
   usability, and/or exchange.</p>
<p>RDF allows multiple objects to be described without specifying the 
detail required.
   The underlying glue, XML, simply requires that all namespaces be defined and
   once defined, they can be used to the extent needed by the provider 
of the metadata.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;
          xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&gt;

   &lt;rdf:Description 
rdf:about=&quot;http://media.example.com/audio/guide.ra&quot;&gt;
       &lt;dc:creator&gt;Rose Bush&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
       &lt;dc:title&gt;A Guide to Growing Roses&lt;/dc:title&gt;
       &lt;dc:description&gt;Describes process for planting and 
nurturing different kinds of rose bushes.&lt;/dc:description&gt;
       &lt;dc:date&gt;2001-01-20&lt;/dc:date&gt;
   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

<p>This simple example uses Dublin Core by itself to describe an 
audio recording
   of a guide to growing rose bushes. With XML and RDF, Dublin Core can now be
   mixed with other metadata vocabularies. For example, the simple Dublin Core
   description above might be used alongside other vocabularies such 
as vCard that
   can describe the author's affiliation and contact information, or a 
more specialized
   &quot;rose description&quot; vocabulary that described the rose 
bushes in greater
   detail.
<p><strong><a id="metadatacontained"
     name="metadatacontained"></a>2.3. Metadata Contained in a 
Resource</strong></p>
<p>Some implementations using Dublin Core have chosen to embed their metadata
   within the resource itself. This approach is taken most often with documents
   encoded using HTML, but is also sometimes possible with other kinds 
of documents.
   Simple tools have been developed to make provision of Dublin Core 
metadata within
   HTML encoded pages fairly easy. One such tool,
   <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/">DC.dot</a>,
   extracts metadata information from an HTML document, and formats it so that
   it can be edited, then cut and pasted back into the HTML header of 
the original
   document.</p>
<p><strong><a id="standalone" name="standalone"></a>2.4. Stand-Alone 
Metadata</strong></p>


<p>Stand-alone metadata can exist in any kind of database, and 
generally provides
   a link to the described resource. This approach is likely to be 
most practical
   for many non-textual resources, and is increasingly used for text 
as well, primarily
   to support easier maintenance and sharing of metadata.</p>

     <h3><a id="basicprinciples" name="basicprinciples"></a>3. Basic
     Principles of Descriptive Elements</h3>


<p>Each element is optional and repeatable. Metadata elements may appear in any
   order. The ordering of multiple occurrences of the same element 
(e.g., Creator)
   may have a significance intended by the provider, but ordering is 
not guaranteed
   to be preserved in every user environment. Ordering or sequencing 
may be syntax dependent, for
   instance, RDF/XML supports ordering, but HTML does not.</p>

     <p><strong><a id="elementcontent"
     name="elementcontent"></a>3.2. Element Content and Controlled
     Vocabularies</strong></p>

     <p>Content data for some elements may be selected from a
     "controlled vocabulary," which is a limited set of consistently
     used and carefully defined terms. This can dramatically improve
     search results because computers are good at matching words
     character by character but weak at understanding the way people
     refer to one concept using different words, i.e. synonyms.
     Without basic terminology control, inconsistent or incorrect
     metadata can profoundly degrade the quality of search results.
     For example, without a controlled vocabulary, "candy" and
     "sweet" might be used to refer to the same concept. Controlled
     vocabularies may also reduce the likelihood of spelling errors
     when recording metadata.</p>

     <p>One cost of a controlled vocabulary is the necessity for an
     administrative body to review, update and disseminate the
     vocabulary. For example, the US Library of Congress Subject
     Headings (LCSH) and the US National Library of Medicine Medical
     Subject Headings (MeSH) are formal vocabularies, indispensable
     for searching rigorously cataloged collections. However, both
     require significant support organizations. Another cost is
     having to train searchers and creators of metadata so that they
     know when using MeSH, for example, to enter "myocardial
     infarction"' instead of the more colloquial "heart attack." More 
sophisticated
     implementations can make such tasks much easier for users, but 
the controlled vocabulary
     terms must be present for them to be able to accomplish that task.</p>

     <p>Using controlled vocabularies can be done most effectively
     using <a href="#qualifiers">qualifiers</a>.</p>

     <h3><a id="coreelements" name="coreelements"></a>4. The Core
     Elements</h3>


<p>This section lists each Core element by its full name and label. 
For each element
   there is a reference description (<a href="/documents/dces/">DCMES 1.1</a>)
   and there are guidelines to assist in creating metadata content, whether it
   is done "from scratch" or by converting an existing record in another format.
   Links to examples and to recommended <a 
href="/documents/dcmes-qualifiers/">Dublin
   Core Qualifiers</a> for each element are also provided.</p>

     <p>The elements are listed in the order they were developed,
     but there are other useful ways to group them. In the following
     table, you can see that some elements relate to the content of
     the item, some to the item as intellectual property, still
     others to the particular instantiation, or version, of the
     item.</p>

<h3><a id="qualifiers" name="qualifiers"></a>5. Qualifiers</h3>
<p><b><a name="qualifierclasses"></a>5.1 Classes of qualifiers</b></p>


<p>In July of 2000, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative issued its 
initial list of recommended
   <a href="/documents/dcmes-qualifiers/">Dublin Core Qualifiers</a>. 
Since that time, additional
   qualifiers have been added as a result of the work of the
   <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/">DCMI Usage Board</a>.</p>

     <p>A this time, the DCMI recognizes two broad classes of qualifiers:</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Element Refinement.</strong> These qualifiers make the meaning of
     an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning
     of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. A client that
     does not understand a specific element refinement term should be 
able to ignore
     the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an 
unqualified (broader)
     element. The definitions of element refinement terms for qualifiers must be
     publicly available.</li>
   <li><strong>Encoding Scheme.</strong> These qualifiers identify schemes that
     aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes 
include controlled
     vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using
     an encoding scheme will thus be a token selected from a 
controlled vocabulary
     (e.g., a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or
     a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation (e.g., "2000-01-01"
     as the standard expression of a date). If an encoding scheme is 
not understood
     by a client or agent, the value may still be useful to a human reader. The
     definitive description of an encoding scheme for qualifiers must be clearly
     identified and available for public use.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="dumbdown"></a>5.2 The Dumb-Down Principle</b></p>
<p>The use of qualifiers as an additional level of detail introduces 
the situation
   where a client can encounter collections of resources that are 
described using
   Dublin Core with qualifiers that are unknown to the client application. This
   can happen either because the client does not support qualifiers 
and the collection
   does, or the collection supports specialized qualifiers developed 
by implementors
   for specific local or domain needs.</p>
<p>The useful interpretation of such descriptions will depend on the ability to
   ignore the unknown qualifiers and fall back on the broader meaning 
of the element
   in its unqualified form. The guiding principle for the 
qualification of Dublin
   Core elements, also known as the &quot;Dumb-Down Principle,&quot; is that a
   client should be able to ignore any refinement and use the description as if
   it were unqualified. While this may result in some loss of specific meaning,
   the remaining element value (minus the qualifier) must continue to 
be generally
   correct. </p>
