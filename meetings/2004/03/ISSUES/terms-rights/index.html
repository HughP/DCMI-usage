SUMMARY (Tom)

A proposal was submitted for two rights-related terms

    <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-rights/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-rights/</a>

There has been considerable discussion on the list, which Andrew
will summarize at the meeting.

One parallel development we should be aware of is an effort
to create an Rights schema for use in OAI:

    <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/documents/OAIRightsWhitePaper.html">http://www.openarchives.org/documents/OAIRightsWhitePaper.html</a>

This short white paper, which refers to dc:rights, will be
included in the supplementary packet, though it may not be
relevant enough to the approval of the current proposals to
discuss in Bath.
