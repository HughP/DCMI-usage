My answer would be the same as the one I gave to the NetInsert people,
i.e. something along these lines...

One approach is that you 'name' your encoding scheme using a URI within
your own namespace, e.g.

http://wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/class/Class

If you do this, then your XHTML encoding would be along the lines of

<link rel="schema.DC" href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" />
<link rel="schema.NLM" href="http://wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/class/" />

<meta name="DC.subject"
      scheme="NLM.Class"
      content="WA 288"
/>

This is in line with the XHTML encoding guidelines at

  http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/

and doesn't require any registration of 'NLMClass' with DCMI.

Note that there are other possibilities for choosing the URI that you use
to name your taxonomy - for example, you could use a PURL

  http://purl.org/NLM/Class

in which case the 'rel="schema' line above will need to be changed.  Note
also that there are psuedo-religious issues around whether you should use
a URIref rather than a URI to name your scheme (i.e. whether it should
have a '#' in it or not).

The above approach can also be used if you choose a future encoding
based on XML, where the instance metadata will look something like

<dc:subject xsi:type="nlm:Class">WA 288</dc:subject>

given an appropriate namnespace declaration for the 'nlm' prefix.
It will also work in RDF/XML (though the syntax is not as shown above).

You might also like to consider assigning a URI (or URIref)  to each of
the terms in your taxonomy?  If so, then a possible way of doing this is
to use the 'info' URI scheme (though note that this isn't a registered URI
scheme yet).  For details see

  http://www2.elsevier.co.uk/~tony/info/info.html

Andy's response provides guidance on using the URI (which
they already have) in encodings, but Diane Boehr seems to be
requesting that DCMI provide approval for NLM classification.

Two responses seem possible:

1) Traugott, who may be out of email contact just now, is going
   to put up a simple Web page listing Subject vocabularies.

2) We could consider whether the DCMI Usage Board can and
   should assign status to this externally maintained term,
   perhaps in the form of an endorsement of an assertion by NLM
   that http://wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/class/ qualifies dc:subject.

Okay, I talked to Diane yesterday. She didn't quite understand everything
I was telling her I don't think. It seems that they are using Dublin Core
elements, but as HTML, not as XML. You can see what they're using at:
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/metafilenew.html. You'll see they're
using that dot syntax. They've used "NLMDC.Subject.NLMClass" as their
element for this encoding scheme.

I explained to her the various options, particularly about declaring a
persistent URI for the NLM classification and/or registering an info:
scheme. (She did say that they are using that NLM classification URI as a
persistent one.) This would work in the context of XML schema or RDF/XML
but didn't have too much meaning for her since they seem to be using the
dot syntax. So she still seemed to be more attracted to having some sort
of registration of NLM classification comparable to what already exists in
dcmi:terms for MESH and LCC.

I suppose how I interpret it is that she would like the option that Tom
mentions below:
"record that assertion in a machine-processable form so that the
endorsement of the NLM term shows up in our Web documents and RDF
schemas;"
I guess that means a fast-track sort of registration/approval by the UB.

Alternatively, I could talk to someone else there who knows more about any
plans they have for setting up namespaces, schemas and the like.
