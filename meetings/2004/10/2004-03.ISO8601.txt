Availability and maintenance status:     
    ISO document (available for a fee)

Appropriateness of maintenance agency:   
    Appropriate

Uniqueness and appropriateness of proposed token:
    Unique, but may be confusion with the other alternative in 8601 
    with hyphens, defined in DC as w3cdtf.

Possible use with elements not specified in proposal     

Other comments:
    Rules for encoding: ISO 8601 has alternatives, with or
    without the hyphen (i.e. 2001-08-07 or 20010807). W3C-DTF
    includes hyphens and is the only encoding scheme currently
    approved in DCMI.  Alternative using no hyphen needs to
    be registered as an encoding scheme, since it is well
    established in the library community.
