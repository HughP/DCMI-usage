</blockquote>

<h3>3. <a id="three." name="three.">Categories of Usage Board Decisions</a></h3>
<a id="recommended" name="recommended"></a>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3.1.</strong> <strong><em>Recommended</em>:</strong> Elements, Element Refinements, and DCMI-maintained Vocabulary Terms (e.g., member terms of the DCMI Type Vocabulary) useful for resource discovery across domains.<br />
<a id="conforming" name="conforming"></a> <strong>3.2.</strong> <strong><em>Conforming</em>:</strong> Elements, Element Refinements and Application Profiles may be assigned a status of conforming. Elements and Element Refinements assigned a status of conforming are those for which an implementation community has a demonstrated need and which conform to the grammar of Elements and Element Refinements, though without necessarily meeting the stricter criteria of usefulness across domains or usefulness for resource discovery.<br />
<a id="obsolete" name="obsolete"></a> <strong>3.3.</strong> <strong><em>Obsolete</em>:</strong> For Elements and Element Refinements that have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete. Such terms will remain in the registry for use in interpreting legacy metadata.<br />
<a id="registered" name="registered"></a> <strong>3.4.</strong> <strong><em>Registered</em>:</strong> Used for Vocabulary Encoding Schemes and language translations for which the DCMI provides information but not necessarily a specific recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>4.2.2.</strong> To be supplied by the UB shepherd:<br />
<strong>4.2.2.1.</strong> A summary history of the post-announcement discussion</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a id="four.3." name="four.3.">4.3.</a></strong> Guidelines: The following criteria are offered as guidelines for developing a proposal -- they reflect criteria that the Usage Board will use in its decision-making. They do not constitute further requirements for the formal documentation of a proposal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.</strong> Criteria for evaluating a term proposal</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.1.</strong> Clarity</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.1.1.</strong> Can the term be clearly defined?<br />
<strong>4.3.1.1.2.</strong> Can the semantics of the proposed element or element refinement be expressed precisely, unambiguously, and briefly?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.2.</strong> Practicality</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.2.1.</strong> Is the term practical?<br />
<strong>4.3.1.2.2.</strong> How difficult would it be for people creating metadata to comprehend the semantics of the proposed element or element refinement and to apply it reasonably in the description of resources?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.3.</strong> Placement</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.3.1.</strong> Does the term refine an existing element?<br />
<strong>4.3.1.3.2.</strong> If the proposed term is an element, can it reasonably be handled as effectively as an element refinement or encoding scheme for an existing element?<br />
<strong>4.3.1.3.3.</strong> Are there alternative ways of implementing the term? Within the conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set (i.e., element/element refinements and encoding schemes), are there alternative ways to achieve the ends sought?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.4.</strong> Needs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.4.1.</strong> Is there a clear requirement in existing implementations for the term in support of resource discovery?<br />
<strong>4.3.1.4.2.</strong> Is there a demonstrated need for the proposed element or element refinement?<br />
<strong>4.3.1.4.3.</strong> Are there existing implementations or encoding schemes, etc., which use the term?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.5.</strong> Fits with other DCMI-maintained terms</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4.3.1.5.1.</strong> Follows existing principles of refinement<br />
<strong>4.3.1.5.2.</strong> Is well-formed<br />
<strong>4.3.1.5.3.</strong> Does not conflict with or create ambiguity with regard to existing DCMI-maintained terms<br />
<strong>4.3.1.5.4.</strong> Does not create problems for existing legacy implementations if those implementations have followed recommended practice</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.4.</strong> Decision tree for assessing the need for a new term</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="0" class="border">
<caption><strong>Decision Tree Table</strong></caption>

<th>Condition 1:</th>
<td>Can the need be solved with a vocabulary encoding scheme for an existing DCMI Element or Element Refinement?</td>

<blockquote>
<p><font color=#ff0000><strong>4.5.2.1.</strong> Proposer must inform the DCMI Managing Director and the UB Chair of the intent to submit a proposal at the earliest possible time in the proposal's development so that the UB Chair can assign a UB member to serve as shepherd for the proposal process and to calendar: (1) the deadline for submission of the proposal; and (2) the date the UB will deliberate and make its decision which must be at least six weeks after the proposal submission deadline.<br />
<strong>4.5.2.2.</strong> No later than six weeks before the submission deadline, the proposer will provide the UB Chair with a draft of the proposal for distribution to the shepherd.<br />
<strong>4.5.2.3</strong> At the time the draft of the proposal is distributed to the shepherd, the UB Chair will schedule a conference call to discuss the draft among, at a minimum, the propose, the shepherd and the UB Chair.  Others participants may be invited at the discretion of the proposer, the shepherd and the UB Chair.  Notes capturing significant issues discussed during the call will be recorded and distributed to the call participants and the UB members.<br /></font>

<strong>4.5.2.4.</strong> <font color=#ff0000>No later than the deadline for submission set by the UB Chair, the proposer shall submit the finished proposal to the DCMI Managing Director and the UB Chair.</font><br />
<strong>4.5.2.5.</strong> Proposal is given preliminary review for completeness by DCMI Managing Director and UB Chair.<br />
<strong>4.5.2.6.</strong> If complete and no revisions needed, proposal is circulated to UB members and announced for public comment by the Managing Director. A period of two weeks will be allowed between the date of the decision on completeness and the public announcement of the proposal to provide time for preparation of the supporting materials for public dissemination.<br />
<strong>4.5.2.7.</strong> If incomplete or revisions needed, proposal is returned to originator, with request for revision or additional information.<br />
<font color=#ff0000><strong>4.5.2.8.</strong> Throught out the periods of discussion and deliberations, UB members are free to comment and join as individuals in listserv discussions of the proposal.  Opinions expressed by UB members during such discussions should not be considered official opinions of the UB.<br />
<strong>4.5.2.9.</strong> Between the close of the public comment period and the UB meeting, the shepherd shall prepare the final version of the proposal and distribute it to the UB.<br />

<p><strong>5.2.1.</strong> Knowledge of a particular scheme<br />
<strong>5.2.2.</strong> Knowledge of the language used in the scheme<br />
<strong>5.2.3.</strong> Interest or knowledge of a particular subject or topical area covered by the scheme<br />
<strong>5.2.4.</strong> Time <font color=red> the member has</font> available for such tasks</p>

<strong>5.4.4.</strong> Uniqueness and appropriateness of the proposed token<br />
<strong>5.4.5.</strong> Possible use with elements not specified in the proposal</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.5.</strong> If necessary, the shepherd will initiate contact with the maintenance agency in the case of questions or concerns about the status of the scheme, the proposed token, or to clarify the submission.<br />
<strong>5.6.</strong> The shepherd will edit the submission and complete the registration process by submitting the information to the DCMI Web Team.<font color=green>[NOTE: Whether or not this is sufficient depends on whether we are still planning to maintain a simple web page of vocabularies.]</font><br />
<strong>5.7.</strong> The DCMI Web Team will report to the UB list when registration has been completed.<br />

<h3>6. <a id="six." name="six.">Proposals for Registration of Application Profiles</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.1.</strong> Sources of proposals</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.1.1.</strong> DCMI working groups <font color=#ff0000>or working groups established for the purpose of developing one or more proposals
</font><br />
<strong>6.1.1.1.</strong> Existing working groups<br />
<strong>6.1.1.2.</strong> Working groups established for the purpose of developing proposals</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.1.2.</strong> Metadata implementers<font color=#ff0000>, established projects or research groups</font> <br />
<strong>6.1.3.</strong> UB itself</p>
<p><strong>6.2.</strong> For the purposes of review by the Usage Board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.2.1.</strong> The Usage Board is interested in reviewing application profiles that make substantial use of Dublin Core elements. The review of application profiles by the Usage Board serves to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.2.1.1.</strong> analyze the usage of Dublin Core within significant implementations;<br />
<strong>6.2.1.2.</strong> assign a DCMI stamp of approval;<br />
<strong>6.2.1.3.</strong> promote the sharing of application profiles between communities; and<br />
<strong>6.2.1.4.</strong> identify new terms as candidates for inclusion in DCMI namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.2.2.</strong> Application profiles must provide, for each term, an identifier of the element set where it is defined, ideally in the form of URIs for individual terms.<br />
<strong>6.2.3.</strong> If the terms in an application profile describe anything other than generic &quot;resources&quot; (the typical domain of Dublin Core), the application profile must make this clear. This is particularly important if an application profile is based on a data model that describes multiple classes of resources, such as agents or collections.<br />
<strong>6.2.4.</strong> It is recommended that application profiles be prepared using previously reviewed application profiles <font color=#ff0000>be prepared using the Dublin Core Application Profile guidelines published by CEN (ftp://ftp.cenorm.be/public/ws-mmi-dc/mmidc076.zip).</font><br />
<strong>6.2.5.</strong> Each application profile must provide, or point to, a short text that describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.2.5.1.</strong> The context and purposes in which the application profile is used or is likely to be used.<br />
<strong>6.2.5.2.</strong> The organizations or individuals involved in its development and a capsule history thereof.<br />
<strong>6.2.5.3.</strong> Any arrangements, policies, or intentions regarding the future development and maintenance of the application profile.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.3.</strong> Review of Application Profiles by the Usage Board</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.3.1.</strong> An application profile is &quot;well-formed&quot; if it is presented in accordance with the broad and flexible requirements outlined above. These presentation requirements may become more specific as &quot;good practice&quot; emerges over time.<br />
<strong>6.3.2.</strong> Usage Board review focuses on the use of terms related to Dublin Core terms and on any data models that provide a context for those terms. The Usage Board is agnostic about the use of terms not directly related to Dublin Core; strictly speaking such terms are outside the scope of Usage Board review.<br />
<strong>6.3.3.</strong> The use of terms related to Dublin Core (such as refinements of Dublin Core elements, or Dublin Core elements that have been constrained for particular contexts) will be evaluated from the standpoint of semantic conformance, grammatical principle (eg, &quot;dumb-down&quot;), clarity, and good practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.4.</strong> Publication and use of Usage Board Reviews</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.4.1.</strong> An application profiles that &quot;pass&quot; review will be assigned the status of 'conforming' <font color=#ff0000>and a date stamp. Changes to the application profile will be considered a new application profile and will require a new submission to the UB and a new timestamp.</font><br />
<strong>6.4.2.</strong> For application profiles that &quot;pass&quot; review, the Usage Board will publish a Review on a Web page for application profiles.<br />
<strong>6.4.3.</strong> Each Review will include, at a minimum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.4.3.1.</strong> Any comments from the Usage Board on the application profile.<br />
<strong>6.4.3.2.</strong> Pointers to locally archived copies of the application profile as originally submitted and (if necessary) as subsequently amended in light of Usage Board comments.<br />
<strong>6.4.3.3.</strong> A pointer to the &quot;latest version&quot; of an application profile held by its maintainers.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.5.</strong> Review represents a form of recognition, and its URL will be persistent for purposes of citation.</p>
