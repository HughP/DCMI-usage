I am getting closer to getting the next draft of the relators out, but
would like to run a few questions by the group.

1. At one point we said that it is better to consider Creator and
Publisher refinements of Contributor, but there was lots of disagreement
about endorsing that so that Creator and Contributor are deprecated. I
want to confirm that we would consider Publisher a refinement of
Contributor in terms of putting in the statement in the RDF that Publisher
is a subproperty of dc:contributor. I also feel that if that is the case
we should also consider Distributor a subproperty of contributor and also
as a subproperty of publisher.

Alternative is not to make the assertion about either of them being a
subproperty of contributor.

2. I am going through the list of terms and looking at what Andy did last
Feb. or March (just before our last meeting), where he took out some of
the assertions. There are a few ways to do this. My feeling is that it
would be better to take a broad view of the definition of contributor and
only take out the subproperty assertion out where it clearly is not
appropriate. Another approach is try to pare down the list to a more core
set. We've discussed both of these approaches for awhile and have gone
back and forth on them. My feeling from our last meeting is that we prefer
to do the former, but want to see if anything had changed.

Any thoughts?

I'm not sure how I've argued this in the past (probably both ways! :-) )
but looking at the definitions now it seems to me that

- when it is the case that a person is a dc:creator of a resource then, by
definition, they are also a dc:contributor to the resource.  This is
always true - therefore it is safe to make the assertion that dc:creator
is a sub-property of dc:contributor.

- when it is the case that a person is a dc:publisher of something, it is
sometimes also true that they are a dc:contributor to it.  But this is not
always true - therefore it is not safe to make dc:publisher a sub-property
of dc:contributor

I'm not sure what you mean by 'broad' here... but, as we've discussed in
the past, if there are any cases (even just one case!) where the assertion
that a given property is a sub-property of dc:contributor is *false*, then
we must not make the assertion.

dc:publisher is a good example.  There are cases where the 'entity
responsible for making the resource available' is *not* also an 'entity
responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource' (e.g.
if you greate a digital photograph and then give it to me to put on my Web
site, then I am the dc:publisher but *not* a dc:contributor) - therefore
we can *not* make the assertion that dc:publisher is a refinement of
dc:contributor.

I will include this latest exchange into the meeting packet.

I have updated
http://www.bi.fhg.de/People/Thomas.Baker/ISSUES/terms-relators/
to try to clarify how exactly we should proceed with this
point over the coming week, then at the meeting in Shanghai.

The following actions (there are others) are particularly
important:

1.  ACTION (Andy and Rebecca): To create one document with
    definitions and sub-property assertions for the relator terms
    and circulate it to the UB list.  

2.  ACTION (everyone): Each UB member will read through the list
    prepared by Andy and Rebecca and sign-off on the sub-property
    assertions.

3.  ACTION (everyone; Tom): DCMI will need to make some form of
    endorsement of the sub-property assertions.  For example,
    the UB should assert that the Relator terms conform to the
    DCMI model and that it agrees with the specific assertions.
    Exactly where and how these assertions/endorsements should
    be made remains to be clarified.

4.  ACTION (Tom and Rebecca): To develop a document defining
    the etiquette for the relationship between DCMI and LC with
    regard to maintaining the assertions.  This document should
    describe any relevant policies on the part of LC (analogous
    to the DCMI Namespace Policy).

I would suggest

-- that Rebecca make the full list available by next Friday,
   if possible, for inclusion in the meeting packet (Point 1);

-- that we all read through the list in preparation for the
   meeting and come prepared to "sign off" on the selection
   (Point 2); 

-- that we then discuss the form that endorsement assertions 
   by DCMI should take (Point 3); 

-- only after which would Tom and Rebecca be in a position
   to propose an understanding between DCMI and LC regarding
   maintenance (Point 4).
