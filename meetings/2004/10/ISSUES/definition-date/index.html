Andy stated the problem on 2004-07-27 on the DC-USAGE list:

    This issue has popped up twice on the lists recently.
    dc:date is defined as

      A date of an event in the lifecycle of the resource.

    which superficially looks like the intention was a single
    date rather than a date range.

    But I tend to agree with what Charles says here.
    Any single date is really a shorthand for a time-range
    (00.00 to 23.59 on the given day)...  so what I suspect
    we really meant by dc:date was

      A date/time (or date/time range) of an event in the lifecycle of the
      resource.

    Would it be worth trying to clarify this in our
    documentation?  Or do people disagree with my analysis
    anyway?

    You could model its availability as an event with a start and end time using
    the RDF/iCal work - <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/">http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/</a>

    Although it is hard to say if this is the same as what dublin core thinks a
    single date might be. If it doesn't, it probably should. Time being a
    continuum (at least as far as we measure it) any date or time represents a
    range...

Pete replied:

    (I was involved in one of the discussions Andy mentioned above [1])

    I was sort of willing to be persuaded by Charles McC-N's message to rdf-
    interest too. i.e. a date is always really a reference to a period of time.

    But.... ISO8601:2000 does make a distinction between

    (a) a date, defined as

    ====
    identification of a particular calendar day, expressed by some combination
    of the data elements calendar year, calendar month, calendar week, calendar
    day or day of the year
    ====

    (b) a time interval or period of time, defined as

    ====
    portion of time between two time points
    ====

    I was kind of surprised to read that a date is always a reference to a
    _day_ but that's what it says.... (it may be of reduced precision)

    If the intention is that a value of dc:date can be either a date, a
    combination of date and time, or a time interval/period of time -
    especially as DCMI has accepted ISO8601 as an encoding scheme - I think the
    terminology in DC definition probably should be consistent with ISO8601
    usage, and there's a case for amending the definition of dc:date.

    FWIW, I think that would still leave open the possibility that some
    refinements of dc:date could specify that their values are specifically
    dates (and not time intervals), if that was required.

    Incidentally, I notice that ISO8601 also supports the representation of
    time of day alone. But I'm assuming a time that is not associated with a
    date is not an acceptable value for dc:date? I'm not sure whether that
    merits some qualifying note in the (forthcoming!) description of ISO8601 as
    an encoding scheme.

    You can get a final(?) draft of ISO8601:2000 at [2]. But I guess you have
    to buy the approved version.
