Background reading
-- An application profile providing context to the proposal
   http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/ElementsVocabularies
   -- Liddy, August 2008: "this is irrelevant to the proposal now"

-- An abstract model for the application profile
   http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/ApplicationProfileAbstractModel
   -- Liddy, August 2008: "an abstract model that relates to application 
      profiles that might be considered elsewhere"

-- Various RDF schemas

   -- Liddy, August 2008: "Long term, of course, I would not want  
      to have those on my website but the purl can easily be changed. I  
      trust they would point to DCMI in the end... or whatever is appropriate?"

2008-08-27 Liddy responses to questions by Tom 

(passages in single quotes are paraphrased, in double quotes are quoted)

'We will find a (non-DCMI) way to declare accessMode,
flexibility, supportTool, role, and readingRate in an
AfA namespace.  We are asking the Usage Board to declare
accessibility in the dcterms: namespace.  Then we will register
an application profile and call it quits.'

[Is "accessibility" particularly salient, or is it more
important than the others (is there a reason "accessibility"
should be declared in a different namespace from the others)?]

"I expect that most people will do no more than give values to
one element. We always thought that. Experts in the field, and
those working on alternatives etc, will use the application
profile. For a while we were convinced to call that main
element 'adaptability' and then it became possible that the
only way forward was to avoid using the main element, that
we hoped would be a DC term, and use accessmode. This is,
I hope, history."

[AccessForAllFramework [2] provides context, but the
document cites itself (a page on accessibilitywiki) as the
home of the Accessibility Framework.  Where do you want to
publish the overall framework itself?]

"I guess now I would go for a DC term published by DC and
the rest just registered in the DC registry and finally close
down leaving a page to provide guidance to DC users."
