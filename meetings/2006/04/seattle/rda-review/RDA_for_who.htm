<p class=MsoNormal>Mar. 12, 2006</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I think about the effort going on now with the evolving
Resource Description and Access (RDA), the image that comes to my mind is some
old film view of the Paris sewers, where sludge covered workers toil tirelessly
and thanklessly to keep the excretions of the body politic moving.  Perhaps not
the best metaphor (or the best smelling one), but one important part to take
from it is that this is all happening somewhat underground, far from the view
of most librarians, and it concerns an important part of the infrastructure
that we depend upon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone will argue with me about the underground part,
pointing out rightfully that the work is now going on far more transparently
than in its first phase as AACR3 (when both process and product were roundly
rejected by its constituency).  As a former cataloger (and former MARBI
member), who has now moved into the digital library world, I had resolved to
keep my distance, with the hope that I’d argued my last about the minutiae of
cataloging. But I kept running up against the stated goal of RDA to be relevant
to the metadata world, as well as the traditional cataloging world, and sure as
shootin’, once I started making snarky comments, I got roped in: I’m now
representing the Dublin Core community on CC:DA.  Surely this is a far too
onerous punishment for my sins!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went into the process with the understanding that I was
going to focus on the “big picture” not the details. This helps me avoid
getting into the detailed discussions beloved of catalogers (for which I have
not the time or inclination), and also has the benefit of allowing me to retain
my reputation as an annoying irritant.  As a former denizen of the traditional
cataloging world who has emigrated permanently to another planet, I hope to
bring a different perspective and worldview to the table. I’m fully reconciled
to the notion that this will not increase my popularity ratings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the aforesaid reluctant involvement, I came to the
discussions rather late. I’d heard, of course, some of the startling early
criticism that there was not enough change from AACR2 being proposed in the
early drafts, with the effort being characterized by some as “rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic.” Given the costs of change, said the critics, let’s make
sure the change is worth the investment.  The Joint Steering Committee (JSC,
keepers of AACR) took notice, went back to the drawing board, and started over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But still, as I pointed out to the RDA-L mailing list a few
weeks ago, there are underlying (and largely unexamined) assumptions made in
RDA, most of which emanate from traditional cataloging practices. These
assumptions are very dissimilar to those inherent in the world of Non-MARC
Metadata (NMM) communities (a term I made up, by the way).  Because traditional
librarians normally work with resources that are digital versions of published
materials, they have difficulty seeing outside that familiar boundary to where
the environment is much less comfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I described my concerns with the current drafts as being in
the following areas: transcription and specified sources of information,
reliance on notes, and multiple versions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Transcription as Identification</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the world of traditional cataloging and static published
resources, consistent transcription is an important method to assure
predictable metadata. However, digital resources carry no such assumption of
stability—change is part of the package.  In that environment, relying on use
of consistently transcribed information as the primary method of identifying a
resource makes much less sense. Resources in the digital environment are most
often identified by a numeric or alpha-numeric string.  In traditional cataloging,
such identifiers are also used, of course: ISSNs and ISBNs are the most obvious
examples, but they are generally not the primary identification of the
resource. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we all know, the current methodologies for identifying
digital resources uniquely and unambiguously are still in flux and almost no
one is satisfied with the current situation.  But whatever the ultimate answer,
it will not rely on transcription, nor will decisions about what constitutes a
“new” or  “different” resource likely be susceptible to the rules defined in
AACR2 for editions or versions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the transcription tradition involves specification
of sources of information from which to record.  Vital to this approach is the
idea that resources have commonly identified and named parts that are similar
within a specific category of materials, something that is not generally the
case in the digital world. Similarly, notions of whether information comes from
the item itself or is supplied from somewhere else are often less important in
NMM communities, even those who still deal primarily with physical, published
items. In ONIX for example, information about the author (from the book jacket,
reviews, or other marketing sources) is specifically tagged based on the
function of the information, and it’s often not explicitly descriptive in
nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Reliance on Notes</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oftentimes, the RDA (like traditional cataloging) herds
catalogers to make decisions about what is “primary” or “secondary” and
relegates the latter to the notes area.  This is a significant problem for many
NMM communities, who may either have no place to put these kinds of descriptive
“notes” or instead rely on repetition of elements (with or without a notion of
order) to capture information of the same kind within a single description,
thus focusing more on access issues than descriptive integrity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In most delivery systems for metadata (including OPACS, it
must be noted), only the information in a small number of specified fields is
actually displayed to the user (and we know few users actually look at full
records). Additionally, because notes can contain so many different categories
of information, they may not even be indexed (when they are, only as
keywords).  For systems using NMM, notes information is even less likely to be
displayed, and may indeed be entirely ignored, since its “human-friendly”
character makes it useless for machine processing and marginal for access. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Multiple Versions and Reproductions </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many traditional catalogers are unfortunately still trying
to make the case for describing an original and a reproduction on the same
record, for the sake of “practicality.” If FRBR is truly the underlying model
for the “new” RDA, it seems to me that this bullet must be bitten firmly and
these practices explicitly marginalized within the context of the rules. In an
environment where metadata of different formats, created using different rules
(or no rules) must be shareable and interoperable, these residual practices
keep us all from benefiting from our common enterprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The argument usually justifying multiple versions on one
record is that most library vendor systems do not display resources with
multiple editions and versions acceptably, but responding to this problem by
undercutting the usefulness of our data by manipulating it to overcome specific
system inadequacies is not the answer. <span style='color:black'>We seem to be
in deep denial that the approaches we’ve used in the past to overcome the
inadequacies of our vendor systems are in fact serious kludges, that will not
allow us to either share data effectively or take advantage of some of the
FRBR-based approaches to improved display of manifestations and expressions.  A
great example of what might be possible can be seen in the work OCLC has done
with FictionFinder--all based on the notion that there is for the most part
sufficient data in the (admittedly MARC) records to associate them more
usefully for display than current library vendors now offer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Interestingly, my post to the
RDA-L list flushed out a few lurkers from the archives and museums community
who said to me, in essence: “RDA doesn’t reflect the needs of our communities
either, not any better than AACR2 did.” Most of these folks are not speaking
out publicly, and I suspect that may well be a reflection of the fact that they
have been cut out of the conversation so long they’ve given up. It’s
interesting to note that in most cases they’ve gone off and created their own
content standards, and in the days when such silos were a reasonable and
acceptable solution, one could hardly blame them. Now, it’s a different
matter—we all need to be thinking more broadly, as the traditional boundaries
between what we’re doing dissolve. As Karen Coyle recently pointed out, we can <span
class=msoDel><del cite="mailto:Diane%20I.%20Hillmann%20User"
datetime="2006-03-12T17:11">do </del></span>plan for these changes ourselves,
or someone else will do it for us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I know that the organizers of the
RDA effort are trying personfully to come up with a solution that is acceptable
to catalogers and to those whose view is more to the forests. But,
unfortunately, most of the conversation molding RDA is happening at the level
of the workers under the streets, in hip boots navigating the sludge, who
aren’t seeing the warning lights flashing above them: <i>WARNING, WARNING, the
end of the world as we know it is upon us.</i></span>  I’m afraid that the more
we depend on catalogers to build the new RDA, the more likely <span
class=msoDel><del cite="mailto:Diane%20I.%20Hillmann%20User"
datetime="2006-03-12T17:12">we are </del></span>that it will be used only in
traditional library settings—which I think most of us believe are becoming a
smaller and more marginal part of what libraries do.  If we want something else
besides AACR3 by another name, we’d better start paying attention and
participating, lest we waste yet another opportunity <span class=msoIns><ins
cite="mailto:Diane%20I.%20Hillmann%20User" datetime="2006-03-12T17:13">to </ins></span>move
out ahead of change, instead of constantly cleaning up after the parade’s gone
by. </p>
