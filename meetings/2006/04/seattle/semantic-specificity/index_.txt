Is it better to use one broader property and specify its
values with vocabulary encoding schemes?  Or to use multiple,
semantically more specific properties?  Is it good practice to
use a broad property but restrict the scope of its application
by annotating the definition accordingly in an Application
Profile?

This issue came up in particular with regard to the
Accessibility profile.  A digest of the discussion [1] is
included in the packet.  Let's please re-read this thread
and consider, in Seattle, whether this is an area in which
the Usage Board could provide further guidance.
