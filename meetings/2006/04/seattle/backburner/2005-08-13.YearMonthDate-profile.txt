If we can agree on a name, I am prepared to "write" a Note describing a 
format that is YYYYMMDD, which is my understanding of one of the 
particular formats that is being sought (are there others that people 
wanted?). I suggest we call it YearMonthDay format.

I think Misha's assessment of how much work is required is pretty accurate 
- armed with a copy of what you want plus Misha's Date Time Format note as 
a template...

I must admit that I had thought that it _was_ part of this groups work to
"develop" some suggestions for date formats - even if ultimately the DCMI Usage
Board recommends that we (or they) need to find a non-DCMI "owner"/maintenance
agency for whatever we come up with.

I wasn't at the DC Date WG meeting at DC-2004 but

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0411&L=dc-date&P=53

says:

===
After lively back-and-forth discussion it was agreed that the Date WG would
explore modifying W3CDTF and/or developing a suitable DCDTF application profile
to meet the requirements of DC Libraries.

>From a purely selfish viewpoint ;-) my own _very_ pressing concern is that this
week (gulp!), I must submit a first draft of a specification based on a Dublin
Core Application Profile. And in that specification I need to provide a URI for
an encoding scheme to support the representation of "open ended" date ranges. It
doesn't have to be a DCMI-owned URI, but I need a description of a date format,
and a means of referring to it within the framework of the DCMI Abstract Model
(as a class or as a datatype).

So, given that this is beyond what is in W3CDTF (for which DCMI provides the
class with the URI http://purl.org/dc/terms/W3CDTF) and ISO8601 (and DCMI
currently provides no URI for the class of things represented by ISO8601
anyway), it seems to me I/we (DC CD WG) have little option but to create our
own specification for that format.

So I've had a go:

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/date-dccd-odrf/

I've just hacked this out this morning (pillaging from the W3CDTF doc) and I'm
sure it needs more work, but, well, it's a start. And as I say, I need
something now, even if it gets refined/tidied up later.

Comments welcome!

Note this is _not_ a profile of ISO8601 because ISO8601 doesn't support "open
date-ranges". (And on that basis I probably shouldn't use phrasing like "an
open date range: a time-interval expressed.... " because I don't think what I
am calling an "open date-range" falls within what ISO8601 calls a "period of
time" or "time-interval". It's a different concept, I think. But I'm not sure!)

Anyway, as Misha and Charles have suggested, I don't think it would be _that_
difficult to identify the formats required and to produce similar documents to
address at least some of the other requirements.

And I think it may be a worthwhile exercise for us to try to do that - and deal
with the social/political/administrative issues (who owns the specs, who assigns
URIs for the encoding schemes etc etc) separately.
