There are 2 things I want to be able to do:

1. Have a way to refer to an encoding scheme that uses what in ISO 8601 is
called the "basic format" for date and time, i.e. YYYYMMDD etc. without
hyphens. W3CDTF uses the "extended format", i.e. YYYY-MM-DD etc. with
hyphens.

2. Have a mechanism to accommodate the other types of dates we talked
about, most of which are not in ISO 8601. These include:
approximate dates
questionable dates
open ended date ranges
BCE dates
Non-Gregorian dates
and maybe also:
Quarter
Season
(the latter 2 have been expressed as needed in Z39.50 several years ago).

To get my need #1, a profile of ISO8601 could be done to include that and
leave out what in ISO8601 we don't want. But I couldn't get those
constructs not now included in 8601 in a profile because they weren't
there to begin with. 

I am trying to get a copy of the new version from NISO-- as we know ISO
doesn't make these freely available. To my knowledge those expressions of
date still aren't accommodated. 

So there would need to be an extension or revision to 8601 rather than a
profile to get #2.

If DCMI were to register all of ISO8601 then I guess I would have #1
available, although it still wouldn't be explicit that what I'm using is
the basic notation in ISO8601, which was my point all along. And I'm told
that registering ISO8601 basic was rejected so I'll have to live with
it. I don't have the energy to fight this one any more.

I'm thinking about doing the extensions within NISO to attempt to get ISO
8601 revised to include these. Emphasize the word "thinking".
