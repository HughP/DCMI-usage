Agenda Item #7 -- Documentation Roadmap

ISSUE: The purpose of DC is resource description -- state what that means.

ISSUE: Point 1.3.2. Kernel -- why have a minimal set? 

AGREED: Total lack of enthusiasm for point 1.3.2

AGREED: 1.4.2. should be renamed to "How to declare a set of metadata terms"

ISSUE: Include Glossary and other legacy documents in Roadmap:
       Bibliography
       Usage Guide -- What role does the document "Using Dublin 
                      Core" play in a world of APs?
       Glossary

       If they are not included in roadmap for documentation we have
       to explicit about what is happening to these key documents
       [Bibliography, Usage Guide, Glossary].

       How do we provide documentation that continues to meet
       the needs of people who are not yet operating under
       APs, as we try to meet the needs of folks using APs?
       We want to think about the pieces that will support
       this transition.

ISSUE: URIs attached to modeling components in DCAM?

ISSUE: Define terms in one place and cite them in other documents.

ISSUE: When writing a document about DCAM, we should be able
       to cite a Glossary, not the DCAM -- you don't want versioning
       of DCAM because of this.

       Look to document management discourse to help us solve
       this term definition problem.

QUESTIONS about glossary:
       Do we want to maintain a glossary that is wide in scope?
       Do we want to maintain terminology that DCMI uses --
       i.e., more focused in scope?

       AGREED we need some sort of glossary or terminology
       list, more tightly focused on DCMI terminology.

AGREED: Wikipedia article should also be part of Roadmap.
