In Madrid (September 2005), the Architecture Working Group
discussed the possibility of adding the fifteen DCMES terms
[1] to the DCTERMS namespace [2] (in addition to them being in
the existing DCMES namespace) -- i.e., to coin [3] in addition
to [4]. This would mean that many DC users would only need
to use a single DCTERMS namespace.  In Madrid, there was no
clear agreement about whether this should be done or not.

Such a change, if approved, would require further changes to
the namespace policy [5,6].  In fact, the change would have
a cascading effect on all DCMI documentation that cites
DCMES URIs.

In the 2006-03-23, we agreed on the need for a small document
summarizing reasons pro and con.  We need a coherent line
on why we would bother to do this.  One possibility from a
process point of view would be for Architecture to ask UB to
take this on as a work item.

ACTION 2006-03-23: Andy - post a discussion for the rationale
to Architecture list for replicating Elements 1.1 in DCTERMS
This input on the list would become input at UB in Seattle.
