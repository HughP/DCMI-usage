All:

Stuart and I concur with the following changes:

The wording as it stands:

5.7. Voting on proposals. Voting shall be limited to scheduled 
meetings and publicly announced conference calls. Voting shall be 
limited to UB members present at the meeting or conference call and 
able to participate in the discussion. UB members who cannot be 
present may present their arguments for or against a proposal in 
writing prior to a meeting (this shall not constitute a vote). UB 
members who cannot be present may explore other options with the 
chair, if they cannot be present for an important vote. In all cases, 
a vote may not be cast by a member who is not present, either 
physically or virtually, for the relevant discussion.

We suggest the following substitution:

5.7. Voting on proposals. Voting shall be limited to scheduled 
meetings and publicly announced conference calls. Except for special 
circumstances approved in advance, voting shall be limited to UB 
members present at the meeting or conference call and able to 
participate in the discussion. UB members who cannot be present are 
encouraged to present their arguments for or against a proposal in 
writing prior to a meeting (this shall not constitute a vote). UB 
members who cannot be present may explore other options with the 
chair, if they cannot be present for an important vote. [last 
sentence eliminated]

I think this wording bends over backwards in accommodating the 
bylaws, without opening us to votes by those who haven't heard the 
arguments.

Fwd: RE: Proposed rewording in Process docThe wording as it stands seems to
allow a chair to publicly announce a conference call for the following day.
Should the wording include something about the period of notice for both
scheduled meetinsg and conference calls?

Perversely, I'm not sure I like imposing these limitations on the ability of
the UB to have ad hoc meetings/calls at very short notice when something
important suddenly needs to be acted on.

OK, that makes sense, but the fact you had to explain it means either
that I'm thick (a likely possibility) or that it isn't clear enough (or
both of course! :-) ).

I wonder if it would be helpful to more clearly distinguish between 'the
discussion' and 'the vote', along the following lines:

5.7. Voting on proposals. Voting shall be limited to
scheduled meetings and publicly announced conference calls.
Except for special circumstances approved in advance, voting
shall be limited to UB members present at the meeting or
conference call and able to participate in the discussion. UB
members who cannot be present [for the discussion] are encouraged to
present their
arguments for or against a proposal in writing prior to a
meeting (this shall not constitute a vote). UB members who
cannot be present [for a vote but who were present for the discussion]
may explore other options with the chair.
