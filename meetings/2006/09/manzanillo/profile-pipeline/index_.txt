DC-Ed Application Profile - 2006-07-20
-- To: dc-ed-ap@u.washington.edu, dc-education@jiscmail.ac.uk

   Diane Hillmann: At the DC-Ed meeting in Madrid, the decision
   was made to change course somewhat in our approach to
   creating an Application Profile, by focusing primarily
   on those elements important to education, leaving the
   others under the general guidance provided by DCMI. Some
   of the impetus for this decision was the difficulties
   we were having in bringing interested parties to the
   table and keeping the conversation about the AP going,
   in the face of competing priorities of those attempting
   to put the document together.  Given those realities,
   it seemed sensible to concentrate on those elements most
   relevant to educational purposes, and attempt to come
   to closure in time for a thorough discussion in Colima.
   For the report of the Madrid session, see:

        http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dcmi/ed/10-05/Breakout-Report-Madrid.html

   The new version, available here:

        http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dcmi/DC-EdAP-7-18-06.html

   Attempts to provide guidance for the following elements:
   Audience, Conforms To, Education Level, Instructional
   Method, Mediator, Subject, Type.

   Several recommended schemes: GEM-BEN (audience),
   NSDLEdLvl (educationLevel), NSDLResType (type), UKEC
   (educationLevel).  UKEL (educationLevel).

   US-centric, so want to to gather recommendations for
   vocabularies in use outside the US and UK, when those
   are in general use and available openly for reuse.

   The Editorial Board for the DC-Government Application
   profile was formed during the DC-Government Working Group
   meeting at the DC-conference in Leganes, Madrid, with
   the objectives to discuss and further develop the draft
   DC-Government Application Profile. The meeting saw value
   in an Application Profile as a reference model to be used
   in government implementations. Rather than developing a
   "one size fits all" AP, this could serve as a good practice
   example, dealing with issues relevant to governments.

UK e-Government Metadata Standard (e-GMS) - 2006-08-30

From: Linda Humphries &lt;linda.humphries@CABINET-OFFICE.X.GSI.GOV.UK&gt;
Technical Policy Team, Cabinet Office, e-Government Unit

    The UK e-Government Metadata Standard (e-GMS) version 3.1
    has been published and is available on the UK GovTalk site [1].

    The Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV) is now the mandated
    encoding scheme for the Subject element. Additional changes include:

    -- Further guidance has been added to the Standard to
       illustrate the correct expression of elements, refinements
       and encoding scheme names
    -- Examples and notes have been updated
    -- Mapping to the UK GEMINI standard has been included.

Unqualified DC Profile for Canadian Institutional Repositories - 2006-05-05

Mark Jordan &lt;mjordan@sfu.ca&gt;, Head of Library Systems, W.A.C. Bennett Library
Simon Fraser University Burnaby, British

    I am part of a group who is developing an
    application profile for a set of Canadian
    Institutional Repositories. We are currently
    aggregating our OAI-PMH metadata in a search interface
    (http://carl-abrc-oai.lib.sfu.ca/) implemented using the
    PKP Metadata Harvester (http://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-harvester/).

    In our application profile, we have decided to 1) use
    only unqualified Dublin Core elements and 2) concentrate
    on selecting and/or developing controlled vocabularies
    and implementation guidelines for populating the uDC
    elements. We have chosen to stay with uDC elements
    in order to provide a low barrier to implementation
    at our partner sites. The goal of this application
    profile is basically to improve end-user searching
    of the aggregated metadata. If you are interested in
    seeing some background information on our activity,
    http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/obj/014005/f2/014005-05209-j1-e.pdf
    provides some examples of the metadata as it stood almost
    a year ago (I have an article coming out in Library Hi
    Tech shortly that contains a fuller analysis).
