-- ISSUE: What is Simple Dublin Core?

-- "Simple DC" is a concept used in a number of ways in a
   number of places.  Do we address it in reference to OAI?

-- "Simple DC is a description set with one description that
   describes a resource with 15 optional property usages"

-- If we say Simple DC is a conforming AP, then folks will
   be using it as a model.

-- Why do we need an AP to say what Simple DC is?  Because you
   have to say the 15 properties are optional and repeatable.

-- What goes on a AP for Simple DC?  It should include those
   properties of the DCMI Profile Model (Application Profile
   of Application Profiles).

-- ISSUE: OAI uses value string language.  Do we put anything
   about value string language in this AP?

-- AGREED: Simple DC includes value string language, and this
   is optional.

-- AGREED: Need to include URI in Simple DC AP, not the QName.

-- AGREED: Do not cite our own XML schemas in the AP for Simple DC

-- ISSUE: Documentation mentioning "Simple Dublin Core" should be 
   revised to point to the Simple DC AP.

Use of "Simple Dublin Core" in DCMI documentation

<a href="/documents/dcmes-xml/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml/</a>

    This document describes an encoding for the DCMES in XML subject to these restrictions:

    * The Dublin Core elements described in the DCMES V1.1 reference can be used
    * No other elements can be used
    * No element qualifiers can be used
    * The resulting RDF/XML cannot be embedded in web pages

<a href="/documents/usageguide/">http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/</a>

    The Dublin Core standard includes two levels: Simple and
    Qualified. Simple Dublin Core comprises fifteen elements;
    Qualified Dublin Core includes three additional elements
    (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group
    of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that refine
    the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in
    resource discovery.

<a href="/documents/usageguide/glossary.shtml">http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/glossary.shtml</a>

    Simple Dublin Core

    The fifteen Dublin Core elements used without qualifiers,
    that is without element refinement or encoding
    schemes. Sometimes referred to as Dublin Core simple.

<a href="/resources/faq/">http://dublincore.org/resources/faq/</a>

    "Simple Dublin Core" is Dublin Core metadata that
    uses no qualifiers; only the main 15 elements of the
    Dublin Core Metadata Element Set are expressed as simple
    attribute-value pairs without any "qualifiers" (such as
    encoding schemes, enumerated lists of values, or other
    processing clues) to provide more detailed information
    about a resource.

    Simple DC XML schema, version 2002-12-12

    This schema defines terms for Simple Dublin Core, i.e. the 15 elements
    from the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</a> namespace, with no use of
    encoding schemes or element refinements.
