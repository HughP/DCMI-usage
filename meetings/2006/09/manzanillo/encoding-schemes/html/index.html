I think we need to do two things:

    1) define what 'syntax encoding scheme' and 'vocabulary
       encoding scheme' mean

    2) agree the categories of our current encoding schemes
       according to our definitions

I'm not totally sure who is responsible for 1) - but I wouldn't like to
let that stop us talking about it! :-)  The definitions in the current
draft of the AM

    <a href="/architecturewiki/AMDraftUpdate">http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/AMDraftUpdate</a>

are as follows:

    A syntax encoding scheme indicates that the value string
    is formatted in accordance with a formal notation, such as
    "2000-01-01" as the standard expression of a date.

    A vocabulary encoding scheme is an enumerable set of which
    a resource is a member, such as the Library of Congress
    Subject Headings.

Problematic cases include language tags and Internet MIME Types.

I'm not convinced that the definitions above are sufficiently
precise to allow us to categorise the current DCMI encoding
schemes without significant debate.  I suggest that we use
these two definitions as straw men, with the intention of
refining them if necessary during the meeting.

Note that our proposed Term Decision Tree at

    <a href="/architecturewiki/TermDecisionTree">http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/TermDecisionTree</a>

doesn't help in making the decision about whether something is a SES or
a VES.  More importantly, it incorrectly asserts that a SES is an RDF
Datatype and a VES is an RDF class.  It is wrong on both counts and
therefore needs updating.
