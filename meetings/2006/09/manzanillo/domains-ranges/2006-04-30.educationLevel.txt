2006-04-30: Proposed definition for Education Level

In: http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/2006/2006-04-30.meeting-notes-final.html

EDUCATION LEVEL

     Problem: AUDIENCE is defined as a class of entity for
     whom the resource is intended.  EDUCATION LEVEL is a
     refinement of audience.  The definition of EDUCATION
     LEVEL is therefore broken.

     AGREED: EDUCATION LEVEL is a refinement of AUDIENCE.
     Need to change the definition of Education Level.
     Change to:

        An audience, defined in terms of its progression
        through an educational or training context, for whom
        the resource is intended.



2009-01-29: Changed usageboard/log URI to usage/minutes URI.
