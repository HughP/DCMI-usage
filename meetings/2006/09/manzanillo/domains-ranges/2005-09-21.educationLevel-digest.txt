I had a message from Thomas Fischer at Goettingen a couple of days ago (part
of which I forward here with his permission), in which he made exactly the
same point:

<quote>
1.
Audience: A class of entity for whom the resource is intended or useful.

educationLevel: A general statement describing the education or training
context. Alternatively, a more specific statement of the location of the
audience in terms of its progression through an education or training context.

I don't understand "class of entity", but doubt that "A general statement
describing the education or training context." fits this description.

I can't remember if this was one of the things covered under the general
clean up of labels/definitions but I think it probably wasn't? And I'm not
sure whether fixing this can be done in a way that would still qualify as
"editorial errata"?

Well, I continue to assert that the values of educationLevel are
"classes of entities" and that when I assert an instance of the property
to be "grade 5", I am meaning the category of students (AgentGroup) that
are situated (in the US and Canada) at a certain point in their
progressing through the "system".  That is why it was conceived as a
subproperty of audience and not some new property.  However, I am afraid
that changing the definition will probably not help at all in changing
practice in the real world.

I'm not sure where to put this just now, but seeing as I started the
thread here a while ago....

I think the work of the DC-RDF-Taskforce looking at property ranges and
domains

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Metadata/DCPropertyDomainsRanges

highlights this problem quite clearly.

Andy has tentatively assigned an rdfs:range of some:AgentGroup to the
property dcterms:audience

  dcterms:audience rdfs:range some:AgentGroup .

which seems quite reasonable, and this implies that whenever I find

  resource:X dcterms:audience _:x .

I can conclude that

  _:x rdf:type some:AgentGroup .

or: the value is an AgentGroup (an instance of the class
some:AgentGroup).

I note we haven't yet suggested a range for dcterms:educationLevel, but
the current definition 

"A general statement describing the education or training context.
Alternatively, a more specific statement of the location of the audience
in terms of its progression through an education or training context."

suggests that the range should be the class of Statements of some sort
(cf dc:rights, which has a range of some:RightsStatement)

So for the sake of argument let's say

  dcterms:educationLevel rdfs:range some:EdLevelStatement .

This implies that whenever I find

  resource:X dcterms:educationLevel _:x .

I can conclude that

  _:x rdf:type some:EdLevelStatement .

But also from the subproperty relation, 

  dcterms:educationLevel rdfs:subPropertyOf dcterms:audience .

I can conclude

  resource:X dcterms:audience _:x .

and so

  _:x rdf:type some:AgentGroup .

i.e. the value is both an AgentGroup and an Education Levels Statement.
I find it hard to imagine a case where that makes sense :-( 

So I think either 

(a) the subproperty assertion is wrong and should be withdrawn or 
(b) the definition of educationLevel needs to be amended so that its
values are "classes of entity....", which Stuart suggested was the
intent [1]

However as I said back at [2] I suspect that current use of
dcterms:educationLevel probably includes values that are either
"statements" or "levels" and not just "classes of entity..." :-(
