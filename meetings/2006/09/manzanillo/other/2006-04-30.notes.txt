2006-04-30 - Discussed "Alternative Paths to Semantic Specificity" 

Decision Tree - this is good when things are clear, but
perhaps not when things are unclear.  When do you define
multiple properties and when do you define a single property
with multiple encoding schemes?  AND is this something about
which the UB can make a decision on?

AGREED: UB should make a statement about this.  Where would
this be stated?  In Application Profiles.  This relates to
best practices for creating good descriptions.

ISSUE: We may not be in conformance with our own decision
on this.  This needs to be addressed in a concrete way.
The word "or" is a problem.  Therefore defining domains and
ranges is very important.

There is also a measure of closeness -- in properties to
resources.  This should be done in Guidelines to Creating
Application Profiles.

CAPTURED: In defining a range to a proposed property if the
word "or" comes up you potentially have a problem.  How many
words different in the proposed definition?  How similar
are the semantics of the resource to the vocabulary encoding
schemes?
