    (HN), Makx Dekkers (MD - partial attendance on Saturday only),
    Diane Hillmann (DH), Traugott Koch (TK), Andy Powell (AP - note
    taker), Rebecca Guenther (RG - Saturday afternoon onwards).</p>

    <p>--- Start of Saturday, 9.00am ---</p>

    <p><b>DCMI Grammar</b><br />
     Decisions:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; Add sentence after 2. heading to define
      'property' and give examples.<br />
       &middot; Add link from document to glossary and vice
      versa.<br />
       &middot; Add words to 2.2.1 to the effect that element
      refinements apply to one element only.<br />
       &middot; Add two components to the grammar called
      'vocabulary encoding scheme' and 'syntax encoding scheme'. TB
      to update section 2.2.2 in line with this.<br />
       &middot; Add discussion at beginning of document to indicate
      in what sense this is a grammar.<br />
       &middot; 2.2.2 - change to 'encoding schemes provide
      contextual &#133;'<br />
       &middot; 2.2.1 - change 'restricted scope' to 'narrower
      semantics'<br />
       &middot; 3 - change 'Controlled-Vocabulary term' to
      'Vocabulary term'.<br />
       &middot; In 2.2.1 take text starting 'A shift from the
      former view&#133;' and turn into a footnote.<br />
       &middot; Change the URL anchor from
      '#controlled-vocabulary-term' to '#vocabulary-term' in both
      principles document and term declarations<br />
       &middot; Change the URL anchors from '#encoding-scheme' to
      more specific '#vocabulary-encoding-scheme' and
      '#syntax-encoding-scheme' in both principles document and
      term declarations</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Usage board Web pages</b><br />
     Attributes of a term declaration:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; Change usage of 'References' attribute to give
      either the URI of the referenced document or a bibliographic
      reference for the referenced document.<br />
       &middot; Change 'This version' to 'Version'.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Process</b></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; Status to be assigned to application profiles
      will be 'conforming'.<br />
       &middot; Take first sentence of section 1 of 'profiles
      document' and add to grammatical principles document.<br />
       &middot; Cut down current app profiles document to text in
      section 1 only.<br />
       &middot; Create link for app profiles document to UB process
      doc.<br />
       &middot; Create link from principles doc to app profiles
      doc.<br />
       &middot; 3.2 - Update definition of 'conforming' to include
      description of what it means in context of app profiles.
      Remove reference to APs from 3.4.<br />
       &middot; Use wording from 5.1 as basis for 7.1. Move wording
      7.3.1 to 7.2.<br />
       &middot; Add 'semantic conformance' before 'grammatical
      principle' in 7.3.4. Need to clarify meaning of 'semantic
      conformance'.<br />
       &middot; In 7.4 need to indicate that APs that 'pass' will
      be assigned status of 'conforming'.<br />
       &middot; Minor corrections/updates to be sent to Stuart by
      email.<br />
       &middot; 2.6.3 - agenda to be available on
      http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/ a few weeks before the

    </blockquote>

    <p><br />
     <b>Encoding scheme registration</b></p>

    <p>Decisions/actions</p>

    <p><b>Guidelines</b></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; Update document in line with earlier decisions
      today.<br />
       &middot; Ask Harry to decide what the real URI for the
      registration service.<br />
       &middot; Change 'value qualifier' and 'element qualifier' to
      use current terminology.<br />
       &middot; Change 'token' to 'name' throughout.<br />
       &middot; Change 'name' to 'label'.<br />
       &middot; Change example - define 'name' as 'token or
      acronym', define 'label' as 'full name').<br />
       &middot; Where there is an existing 'authoritative' registry
      for a vocabulary encoding scheme we should only ask for the
      DCMI vocabulary encoding scheme name and the URI for the
      entry in the external registry. Traugott to update guidelines
      to reflect this. Also add field for known other tokens for
      this scheme.<br />
       &middot; Move 2.4 to 2.3. Change 2.3 to read 'Any schemes
      that adhere to the guidelines below will be given the status
      'registered' (or 'recommended') in the DCMI registry.<br />
       &middot; Remove related links.<br />
       &middot; Remove mention of 'Recommended' status.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Tool</b></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; No translation of user-interface for the time
      being.<br />
       &middot; Hence, no requirement to use Unicode for the time
      being.<br />
       &middot; Rejection reason added to comment field.<br />
       &middot; Rejections left in the database but only made
      visible to admin, not to end-users.<br />
       &middot; Only things of status 'registered' or 'recommended'
      should be publicly searchable.<br />
       &middot; Clear date-stamp on info displayed about schemes.
      Provide link for people to send in updates/corrections.
      Database kept up to date on best-efforts basis by combination
      of Web team and UB.<br />
       &middot; Existing 'recommended' schemes (with exception of
      DCMIType) should now become 'registered'. (Note this was also
      agreed at last meeting!).<br />
       &middot; All registered schemes will go into the DCTERMS
      namespace (in line with the DCMI Namespace policy). The tool
      will display the term URI in output views. (Note: subsequent
      decisions by DC Architecture group go against this in favour
      of separate namespace for new encoding schemes).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Schema representations</b></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; All names added to DCTERMS namespace must have
      been through the UB process.<br />
       &middot; Only things covered by the DCMI grammar are allowed
      in the DCTERMS namespace.<br />
       &middot; UB is responsible for the content of the
      machine-readable schema representations of all DCMI terms -
      and need to have mechanisms to ensure quality control of
      those schemas.<br />
       &middot; Structure of DCMI schemas is responsibility of the
      DC-Architecture WG. (Note need to fix DC Architecture WG
      process.)<br />
       &middot; Structure of DCMI schemas could be the subject of a
      DCMI Schema Policy - i.e. a DCMI recommendation.<br />
       &middot; There needs to be coordination between UB and
      DC-architecture to ensure that schema structure represents
      DCMI grammar and terms.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Need to add first three bullet points to the UB mission
    statement.</p>

    <p>--- Close of Saturday, 6.00pm ---</p>

    <p>--- Start of Sunday, 8.30am ---</p>

    <p><b>DC-Government</b></p>

    <p><b>Access Rights</b></p>

    <p>Accept.</p>

    <p>Change definition to: "Information about who can access the
    resource or an indication of its security status."</p>

    <p>Change comment to: "Access Rights may include information
    regarding access or restrictions based on privacy, security or
    other regulations."</p>

    <p>Note: This decision merges two proposals, accessRights and
    securityClassification, on the basis that:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; there appeared to be significant overlap between
      the two proposals, and<br />
       &middot; protective markings can be indicated using the
      access rights qualifier with an associated vocabulary
      encoding scheme.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Security Classification</b></p>

    <p>Reject: (see decision for Access Rights).</p>

    <p><b>Acquired</b></p>

    <p>Reject: too much overlap with dcterms:accepted. UB
    considered that there was insufficient distinction between
    existing dcterms:accepted and this proposal.</p>

    <p>Suggest use of dcterms:accepted instead, with use of 'Date
    Acquired' as label in application profile if desired.</p>

    <p>Note: TB to produce statement of 'insufficient distinction'
    for UB mission.</p>

    <p><b>DC-Libraries</b></p>

    <p>Several decisions noted by Rebecca.</p>

    <p>Issue raised about whether URI can be used with
    dc:description. The general principle of whether it is
    semantically OK to use URI with dc:description not really
    resolved, but for this particular case it was noted that URI
    had never been voted on as an encoding scheme for
    dc:description and that therefore it is not currently
    permissible to use it in this way.</p>

    <p>A few new encoding schemes need to be registered - agreed
    that we use existing fast track mechanism to do this rather
    than wait for encoding scheme registration tool.</p>

    <p>General recommendation: an application profile cannot be
    conforming unless:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; it uses elements and qualifiers in line with DCMI
      grammar,<br />
       &middot; it only uses particular qualifiers in line with
      existing DCMI term declarations (e.g. you cannot currently
      use URI as an encoding scheme for dc:description).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Unresolved discussion about whether <b>all</b> schemes used
    in 'conforming' application profiles must be 'registered' with
    DCMI.</p>

    <p><b>bibliographicCitation</b></p>

    <p>Approve.</p>

    <p>Change "Proposed status" to "Conforming".</p>

    <p>Change end of comment to "&#133;whether or not the citation
    is in a standard form".</p>

    <p><b>Creator/Contributor and MARC relator codes</b></p>

    <p>Agreed to declare dc:creator as refinement of
    dc:contributor.</p>

    <p>Long discussion about whether all MARC relator terms are
    refinements of dc:contributor.</p>

    <p>Agreed that the UB will make statements about a sub-set of
    MARC relator terms being refinements of dc:contributor.</p>

    <p>Sub-group of UB will propose a list of MARC terms to be
    emailed to UB list for approval. DH, RG and AP to agree the
    list.</p>

    <p>Need to draft a document about this - as a UB decision.
    Action: TB.</p>

    <p>RG to provide TB with background info about semantics and
    rationale about MARC relator list.</p>

    <p>(Note subsequent discussion about this issue in DC Agents WG
    and DC Architecture - agreed that, as owners of the codes, LoC
    should:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&middot; create namespace for MARC relator codes,<br />
       &middot; put <b>all</b> codes in the namespace,<br />
       &middot; make RDF Schema for <b>all</b> codes
      available,<br />
       &middot; make assertion in the RDF schema that <b>all</b>
      codes are refinements of dc:contributor.<br />
       Then all terms will become available for use in APs.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Structured Values</b></p>

    <p>Agreed that the 4 documents (DCSV, DC-Point, DC-Box,
    DC-Period recommendations) need updating - to remove dodgy
    examples and remove XML encoding syntax. Agreed to raise this
    with DC-AB at meeting after DCMI2002. Need to evaluate impact
    on community of this action. UB willing to take on this work if
    necessary.</p>

    <p>Add text to UB principles to include issues of 'structured
    values' and include principle that 'the element value when
    taken as a whole should fall within the semantics of the
    element'. TB</p>

    <p>Need to develop a 'UB view of structured values' as a 2-page
    document for sharing with DC-AB and DC-Architecture. AP</p>

    <p>Once UB principles are agreed we can go back to Citation WG
    and Libraries WG with advice about submitting proposals for
    structured values.</p>
