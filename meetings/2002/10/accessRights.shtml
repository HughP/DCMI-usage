    Security classification and access rights are not the same.
    Security classification deals with any official security
    "stamp" to give a particular status to the resource. Only some
    resources will have such a stamp. Access rights do not need
    official stamps and can be used more loosely for the handling
    of the resource, e.g. a resource marked "public" in a content
    management system can be published, a resource marked
    "not-public" will not be, although metadata about the resource
    could be published). The "nature" of the two qualifiers is
    different, but the values could be related, e.g. if the
    security classification = "Top secret" then access rights
    should contain a value reflecting this. The difference between
    accessRights and audience is that audience contains values
    stating which segment of the user-group the information in the
    resource is created for. accessRights states which user-group
    has permission to access the resource, it does not say anything
    about the content (which audience does). <br />
     <br />
     For full implementation of this refinement, a namespace is
    needed. Inclusion in DC will mean the availability of a
    practical, usable namespace.

    <h2>Remarks about qualifier from DC GOV community
    2001.08.01-2002.08.01</h2>
    14 sept 2001 Nancy Brodie <br />
     There is a need to indicate access rights for resources that
    are not "open" and these possible access limitations are not
    based on copyright. So it is a good idea to specify some other
    rights. Achieving generic terminology here will be difficult
    since rights are most often based on national legislation.
