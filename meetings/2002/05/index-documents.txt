Description:

   This page, periodically updated, provides annotated links
   to process and policy documentation produced by or relevant
   to the DCMI Usage Board.  Documentation of DCMI metadata
   terms -- the DCMI Type Vocabulary, the Dublin Core Metadata
   Element Set version 1.1, plus all elements and qualifiers
   approved since DCMES 1.1 -- is in the process of being
   significantly overhauled and will be available at
   http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/.


== Mission and Principles
   http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/mission/

   This document describes the scope and mission of the DCMI Usage Board,
   summarizing the principles of "grammar" according to which it maintains
   the metadata vocabularies of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.  This
   description complements that of the DCMI Namespace Policy (see below), 
   which also defines terms of reference.

== Namespace Policy for the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)
   http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/

   An XML namespace is a collection of names, identified by a
   URI reference, that are used in XML documents as element
   types and attribute names.  The use of XML namespaces to
   uniquely identify metadata terms allows those terms to be
   unambiguously used across applications, promoting the
   possibility of shared semantics.  DCMI adopts this mechanism
   for the identification of all DCMI terms.  This document
   specifies the conventions used for identifying current and
   future DCMI namespaces.  All DCMI recommendations that make
   use of namespaces will conform to this recommendation.
