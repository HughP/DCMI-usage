    proposes a new element Holding Location that is included in the
    proposed DC-Library Application Profile. This review period is
    15 April-11 May 2002.</p>

    <p><i>DC:Publisher.</i> Other communities have needed to supply
    the holding location for physical objects described using
    Dublin Core. CIMI filled this need for museums by adopting the
    Publisher element. For museum materials, which are largely
    unpublished, this did not create an internal conflict. However,
    for libraries, where the majority of resources are published,
    it is crucial to distinguish between the actual publisher and
    the holding location. (A variation on the CIMI option is to use
    the Contributor or Publisher elements with an appropriate Role
    qualifier once the technique for expressing Role is finalized.)
    The drawback would be the inability, in any unqualified DC
    systems to distinguish, for example, works by Oxford University
    from those held at Oxford University, with predictably bad
    consequences for search precision. The relationship of a
    holding institution to an information resource can be
    considered to be quite different conceptually from the
    relationships between other "agents" and the resource.</p>

    <p><i>DC:Identifier.</i> The definition of DC:Identifier is "an
    unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context."
    DCMES considers recommended best practice is to identify the
    resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal
    identification system. In the case of Holding Location, applied
    to non-electronic resources, many lack identifiers from a
    formal identification system. Thus, any qualifier adopted for
    DC:Identifier would not refine but change the approved
    definition.</p>

    <p><i>MARC Field 852.</i> The proposed element is roughly
    equivalent to field 852 in the MARC 21 Bibliographic and
    Holdings Formats, which is defined as information that
    identifies the organization holding the item or from which it
    is available. It is not clear what it means to reference a MARC
    element in a DC profile (further discussion needed), so this
    approach has not been pursued.</p>

    <p><i>VRA (Visual Resources Association) Core Version 3.0.</i>
    The proposed element is equivalent to Location.Current
    Repository. Since that standard is limited to description of
    visual resources and the definitions convey that, it would not
    be appropriate to simply reference the element.</p>

    <p><b>Application of this element:</b></p>

    <p>Holding Location could be used with a value from an
    authority which would be registered as a DCMI encoding scheme
    or it can contain the name of the organization responsible for
    access. DC-Libraries WG intends to register as an encoding
    scheme the <i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i>; also to be
    considered is the need for other encoding schemes, possibly a
    URI to an entry in an authority file.</p>

    <p><b>Issues with this element:</b></p>

    <p>The element could be considered administrative metadata in
    nature (i.e. metadata used in managing and administering
    information resources) rather than resource discovery metadata.
    However, one could argue that unless you can find something,
    you haven't discovered much. Where a physical resource can be
    found is certainly as critical to successful resource discovery
    as Rights, for example. Rights can tell you whether you may or
    may not use the item. If you are permitted to use it, you will
    need to know where it is. See further discussion as indicated
    above under "about the proposers".</p>
