<h2 align="center"><b>Proposal: Agent roles in DCMES </b></h2>
<h3 align="center"> 5 April 2002</h3>
<p> This proposal is submitted by Rebecca Guenther for review by the DC-Agents 
  and DC-Libraries Working Groups. It proposes establishing element refinements 
  for the Dublin Core elements Creator and Contributor to express a role in relation 
  to the resource. A second proposal has been submitted by Robina Clayphan for 
  a proposed DCMI Agent Detail Encoding Scheme. </p>
<hr>
<p> <b>1. Background.</b></p>
<p> The need to express a role for the &quot;Agent&quot; elements (Creator, Contributor, 
  and, to a lesser extent, Publisher) in the Dublin Core element Set has been 
  expressed for many years. There have been a number of proposals for how to handle 
  this, but currently there are no approved element refinements for these three 
  Dublin Core elements. A role is a term that further refines the contribution 
  of the agent to the resource described; an example is &quot;illustrator&quot; 
  as a refinement to the element Contributor when that person provided, for example, 
  illustrations to the resource rather than being entirely responsible for all 
  aspects of the intellectual content. </p>
<p> Over the years suggestions have been made to add a &quot;role&quot; qualifier 
  for the Agent elements which would contain a value, preferably from a controlled 
  list. <a href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-agents/files/wd-agent-qual.html#AGENT-ROLE">A 
  proposal</a> was presented in December 1999 which suggested that &quot;role&quot; 
  be what was then called a &quot;value component&quot; of the elements. Subsequent 
  to this, before the voting commenced, the proposal was revised to include a 
  short list of roles (a subset of the MARC relator list) that were put forward 
  as element refinements to the three elements (see below). However, when the 
  Dublin Core Usage Committee conducted its vote on Dublin Core qualifiers, this 
  proposal was rejected and no qualifiers were approved for Creator, Contributor, 
  and Publisher because of the feeling by some members that all qualifiers (including 
  &quot;value components&quot;) be approved as a package. </p>
<p>The DCMI Usage Board discussed the issue further in Sept. and Oct. 2001 and 
  agreed (again) that the role values are properly element refinements. The group 
  also generally agreed that deprecating Creator and Publisher in favor of Contributor 
  should be considered; the role values Creator and Publisher could be used to 
  refine Contributor if needed. This consensus is what is reflected in the October 
  2001 version of the <a href="/documents/library-application-profile/">DC-Libraries 
  Application Profile</a>. However, it was recognized that the idea needed further 
  discussion particularly by the Agent Working Group. </p>
<p>Meetings of the DCMI-Agents Working Group over the last few years have continued 
  to discuss the need for roles, although more attention has been given to an 
  Agent element set. After the October 2001 meeting, the group included a deliverable 
  in its work plan to develop a proposal for CCP qualifiers. This proposal is 
  a result of that deliverable (assigned to Rebecca Guenther and Robina Clayphan). 
</p>
<p>The DC-Libraries Application Profile is in the process of revision. The need 
  for expressing the relation between the contributor and the resource is clear 
  and will be included in the profile. It is important that the Agent Working 
  Group discuss the issue so that a formal proposal can be submitted to the Usage 
  Board to finally approve qualifiers for Creator, Contributor, and Publisher. 
</p>
<p>In a meeting of the DC-Libraries Application Profile drafting committee held 
  in January 2002 consensus was reached that rather than specify a subset of the 
  LC Relators list terms, that any term be available for expressing the relation 
  of the agent to the work. There are about 175 terms on the list, so it would 
  be difficult to submit proposals for each term as an element refinement. The 
  feeling was that users not be constrained to a small list when their applications 
  may require more specificity, and a fuller list is readily available and a well-accepted 
  standard. Additional terms could be added as needed by submitting requests to 
  the Library of Congress. </p>
<p><b>2. Proposal for a small set of relator terms as element refinements. </b></p>
<p> The following was submitted to the DCMI Usage Board in October 2002: </p>
<p><b>Proposal for including Roles for Creator/Contributor/Publisher in Dublin 
  Core </b></p>
<p>The Agent Working Group has discussed the elements Creator, Contributor and 
  Publisher and how to allow for expressing attributes of agents associated with 
  a resource. In addition it has in its charge looking at element refinements 
  for these elements. It seems unlikely that this group will make substantial 
  progress both on the Agent Core (the main topic of their agenda at DC-9) and 
  element refinements, particularly for roles. </p>
<p>There is general consensus (particularly among members of the Usage Board as 
  well as in previous discussions within the DCMI) that agent roles are attributes 
  of the agent in relation to the resource described, so thus they should be expressed 
  as element refinements of the agent elements. In addition, the Usage Board has 
  discussed the possible deprecation of Creator and Publisher in favor of using 
  Contributor for all agents associated with a resource. </p>
<p>This proposal suggests that element refinements be approved for Contributor 
  to indicate the role of the contributor in relation to the resource. The following 
  roles and definitions come from the MARC Code List for Relators (with some minor 
  revisions to make the definitions more generally applicable). Role terms would 
  be approved for use with the element, although applications could use the appropriate 
  code if preferred (some, such as Open Ebook are already using relator codes 
  with DCMES). Note that Creator and Publisher are already defined as roles; these 
  would be used with Contributor and would be equivalent to using the element 
  Creator or Publisher, respectively. </p>
<p>The following is essentially what was proposed to DCMI as element refinements 
  in early 2000 (with a few changes), but was not approved because of the perceived 
  need to consider all aspects of CCP element refinements and structured values 
  separately. Other element refinements indicating roles could be approved if 
  needed; they should be taken from the MARC list with the official semantics. 
</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Library of Congress maintain this list in conjunction 
  with the larger MARC Code List of Relators. Thus, LC would define a subset of 
  the larger list and maintain that documentation on the Web. These role terms 
  would also be registered as element refinements of Contributor in the DCMI registry. 
  This would enable LC to be able to maintain consistency with the complete list. 
  If users require a role not on the LC list, they can apply for a new code/term; 
  if approved, it would be included both on the officially maintained list at 
  LC and in the DCMI registry. </p>
<p>An alternative is to allow for any of the role terms on the list to be used, 
  but that would require all to be defined as element refinement for Contributor. 
  Since the list includes many codes designed for use with very specific types 
  of applications, this does not seem appropriate for a cross domain <b>element 
  set such as Dublin Core. </b></p>
<p>Proposed Relators list for general applications (Dublin Core) </p>
<p>Principles for inclusion: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The term is not specific to a material type. </li>
  <li> Only general creator/author terms are used, rather than specific ones. 
  </li>
  <li> Usage is for general application only; the broadest terms are included.</li>

<p><b>3. Proposal for use of the full list of terms for relators. </b></p>
<p> As mentioned above, the DC-Libraries Application Profile drafting committee 
  meeting resulted in consensus that users not be constrained by a small list 
  of elements and that the entire list of relator terms be available. In addition, 
  the group recommended retaining the three CCP elements and leaving it to the 
  application as to whether it wishes to combine Creator and Contributor (or all 
  three). </p>
<p>The following are notes from that meeting (full notes are available). </p>
<p><b>Creator/Contributor/Publisher. </b></p>
<p><i>Elements. </i>DC-Lib AP currently suggests combining these three elements 
  and using only Contributor. This possibility had been discussed by the DCMI 
  Usage Board recently. However, this approach has not been officially approved 
  by either the DCMI-Agents Working Group or the Usage Board. Thus, the group 
  preferred to retain the three elements and allow for an institution to collapse 
  them if desired. (For instance, NLM prefers to use only Contributor for both 
  Creator and Contributor but retain Publisher.) It was recognized that for many 
  uses it was necessary in library applications to distinguish publisher separately. 
  Stu Weibel thought that it made implementations more complicated to throw out 
  some elements, and that there may be little payoff to doing that. In any case 
  there is an expectation that at least Creator and Contributor (perhaps also 
  Publisher) would be indexed together anyhow, and there may be no benefit to 
  throwing some of them out. Roles can be used for an application that desires 
  to conflate all or some of the elements, such as Contributor.Creator. </p>
<p><i>Decision: </i>Allow for using all three elements, but applications can conflate 
  them if desired. <br>
  <i>Reason: </i>This allows more flexibility with existing records and there 
  is not a big payoff in conflating them. Systems can still index them together 
  if desired. </p>
<p><i>Roles. </i>It is desirable to define a vocabulary to be used with a role 
  qualifier. DC-Lib AP will specify the use of the MARC relator code list; other 
  lists could also be used if defined. If a subset of that list is desired it 
  may be necessary to define what that subset is (either through DCMI-Agents WG 
  or the AP). If the subset is found to be constraining, any value on the list 
  should be possible. Robina Clayphan will contact Andy Powell to discuss the 
  question of syntax and element refinement versus structured value. </p>
<p><i>Decision:</i> Use MARC relator list and allow for any value from that list; 
  explore how to do this syntactically.<br>
  <i>Reason: </i>Users should not be constrained by a subset list since applications 
  may vary. </p>
<p>The remaining issue was how to express this syntactically. An exchange with 
  Andy Powell concerning possible syntax is available at in the archives of the 
  DC-Libraries-AP list. </p>
<p>This brought up the issue of namespaces if a DC term from another namespace 
  was being used as an element refinement. However, it is possible that an agreement 
  could be reached between DCMI and the Library of Congress on how to work out 
  these issues so that the relator terms could be reference as part of a DC namespace 
  while the list could be maintained by the Library of Congress. </p>
<p><b>4. Current Proposal </b></p>
<p> The following is proposed for establishing qualifiers for Creator and Contributor. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allow for the use of any term on the MARC relator list to be used with Creator 
    or Contributor. 
    <ul>
      <li> Note that Publisher is being excluded; the only term that is appropriate 
        for use with that element is perhaps Distributor, which could be considered 
        as a refinement itself. </li>
      <li> This approach would probably involve establishing a token and URI for 
        each relator term. The token could be the code already defined in the 
        list, while the human readable label could be the term itself. </li>
      <li> It is possible that other controlled lists of relator terms could be 
        used; this would require submission of such to the DCMI-Usage Board. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Ask the DCMI-Architecture working group to develop recommendations for 
    appropriate syntax for expressing these element refinements. </li>
  <li> Resolve the namespace issues of using terms from an externally maintained 
    scheme in a DCMI namespace. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
