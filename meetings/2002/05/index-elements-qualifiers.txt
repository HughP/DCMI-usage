Introduction

This document is a consolidated representation of metadata terms
recommended by DCMI as of the Date Last Modified in the document
header information.  Specifically, this includes all of the
terms defined in the Dublin Core Element Set version 1.1 of 2
July 1999 [DCMES], the Dublin Core Qualifiers of 11 July 2000
[DCQ], and three additional terms approved on 21 May 2001 by the
Usage Board [DECISION2001.01] -- in short, all of the terms
recommended by DCMI to date except for those of the DCMI Type
Vocabulary, which is described in a separate document [DCT1].

This consolidated document replaces the earlier documents as the
authoritative representation of DCMI metadata terms.  As of
April 2002 it is expected that this document will eventually be
replaced by a terminological database, or Vocabulary Management
System (VMS), which will become the definitive repository of the
definitions and related versioning information for DCMI metadata
terms (see [DC-REGISTRY]).

After extensive discussions on DCMI mailing lists and in
accordance with a decision of the Usage Board [DECISION2001.02],
this document describes metadata terms with the attributes used
in the Dublin Core Qualifiers recommendation of July 2000
{DCQ] rather than those used for the Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set, version 1.1, of July 1999 [DCMES], which were based
more closely on the ISO/IEC 11179 standard [ISO11179].

The DCMI terms represented here are described with the following
attributes, of which URI of Term, Name, Label, Definition, Term
Type, and Decision are obligatory:

   Name:              The unique token assigned to the term.
   URI:               The unique identifier of a term (see [TERMS]).
   Label:             The human-readable label assigned to
                      the term.
   Definition:        A statement that represents the concept
                      and essential nature of the term.
   Comment:           Additional information about the
                      term or its application.
   See Also:          A link to more information about the term, 
                      such as supporting documentation for the 
                      original proposal to the Usage Board.
   Term Type:         Element, Element Refinement, or Encoding Scheme
                      (see [PRINCIPLES]).
   Terms Qualified:   If a "qualifier" (Element Refinement or Encoding
                      Scheme), name(s) of the Element(s) qualified.
   Status:            Status assigned to term by Usage Board 
                      (see [TERMS] and [PROCESS]).
   Decision:          Number of Usage Board decision (see [DECISIONS]).
   VMS note:          Additional information of relevance to the
                      planned Vocabulary Management System.

                 of the resource.
                 Recommended best practice is to select a value from a
                 controlled vocabulary or formal classification scheme.
    Term Type:   Element

    Label:       Date

                 resource.
    Comment:     Typically, Date will be associated with the creation or
                 availability of the resource.  Recommended best practice
                 for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of
                 ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and follows the YYYY-MM-DD format.

                 genres, or aggregation levels for content. Recommended best
                 practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary
                 (for example, the working draft list of Dublin Core Types
                 [DCT1]). To describe the physical or digital manifestation
                 of the resource, use the FORMAT element.
    Term Type:   Element
    Decision:    http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/index.shtml#1999.01

<a name=format>
    Name:        format
    URI:         http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/format
    Label:       Format
    Definition:  The physical or digital manifestation of the resource.
    Comment:     Typically, Format may include the media-type or dimensions of
                 the resource. Format may be used to determine the software,
                 hardware or other equipment needed to display or operate the
                 resource. Examples of dimensions include size and duration.
                 Recommended best practice is to select a value from a
                 controlled vocabulary (for example, the list of Internet Media
                 Types [MIME] defining computer media formats).

                 of a string or number conforming to a formal identification
                 system.
                 Example formal identification systems include the Uniform
                 Resource Identifier (URI) (including the Uniform Resource
                 Locator (URL)), the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and the
                 International Standard Book Number (ISBN).

    Definition:  A reference to a resource from which the present resource
                 is derived.
    Comment:     The present resource may be derived from the Source resource
                 in whole or in part.  Recommended best practice is to reference
                 the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a
                 formal identification system.

    Label:       Language

    Comment:     Recommended best practice is to use RFC 3066 [RFC3066],
                 which, in conjunction with ISO 639 [ISO639], defines two-
                 and three-letter primary language tags with optional
                 subtags.  Examples include "en" or "eng" for English,
                 "akk" for Akkadian, and "en-GB" for English used in the
                 United Kingdom.

                 of a string or number conforming to a formal identification
                 system.

    URI:         http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage
    Label:       Coverage
    Definition:  The extent or scope of the content of the resource.
    Comment:     Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name
                 or geographic coordinates), temporal period (a period label,
                 date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named
                 administrative entity).
                 Recommended best practice is to select a value from a
                 controlled vocabulary (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic
                 Names [TGN]) and that, where appropriate, named places or time
                 periods be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as
                 sets of coordinates or date ranges.

    Name:        rights
    URI:         http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/rights
    Label:       Rights Management  
    Definition:  Information about rights held in and over the resource.
    Comment:     Typically, a Rights element will contain a rights
                 management statement for the resource, or reference
                 a service providing such information. Rights information
                 often encompasses Intellectual Property Rights (IPR),
                 Copyright, and various Property Rights.
                 If the Rights element is absent, no assumptions can be made
                 about the status of these and other rights with respect to
                 the resource.
