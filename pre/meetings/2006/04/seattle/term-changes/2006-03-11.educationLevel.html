I had a message from Thomas Fischer at Goettingen a couple of
days ago (part of which I forward here with his permission),
in which he made exactly the same point:

&lt;quote&gt;
1.
Audience: A class of entity for whom the resource is intended or useful.

educationLevel: A general statement describing the education or training
context. Alternatively, a more specific statement of the location of the
audience in terms of its progression through an education or training context.

I don't understand "class of entity", but doubt that "A general statement
describing the education or training context." fits this description.
&lt;/quote&gt;

I can't remember if this was one of the things covered under the general
clean up of labels/definitions but I think it probably wasn't? And I'm not
sure whether fixing this can be done in a way that would still qualify as
"editorial errata"?

Well, I continue to assert that the values of educationLevel are
"classes of entities" and that when I assert an instance of the property
to be "grade 5", I am meaning the category of students (AgentGroup) that
are situated (in the US and Canada) at a certain point in their
progressing through the "system".  That is why it was conceived as a
subproperty of audience and not some new property.  However, I am afraid
that changing the definition will probably not help at all in changing
practice in the real world.

I'm not sure where to put this just now, but seeing as I started the
thread here a while ago....

I think the work of the DC-RDF-Taskforce looking at property ranges and
domains

<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Metadata/DCPropertyDomainsRanges">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Metadata/DCPropertyDomainsRanges</a>

highlights this problem quite clearly.

Andy has tentatively assigned an rdfs:range of some:AgentGroup to the
property dcterms:audience

  dcterms:audience rdfs:range some:AgentGroup .

which seems quite reasonable, and this implies that whenever I find

  resource:X dcterms:audience _:x .

I can conclude that

  _:x rdf:type some:AgentGroup .

or: the value is an AgentGroup (an instance of the class
some:AgentGroup).

I note we haven't yet suggested a range for dcterms:educationLevel, but
the current definition 

"A general statement describing the education or training context.
Alternatively, a more specific statement of the location of the audience
in terms of its progression through an education or training context."

suggests that the range should be the class of Statements of some sort
(cf dc:rights, which has a range of some:RightsStatement)

So for the sake of argument let's say

  dcterms:educationLevel rdfs:range some:EdLevelStatement .

This implies that whenever I find

  resource:X dcterms:educationLevel _:x .

I can conclude that

  _:x rdf:type some:EdLevelStatement .

But also from the subproperty relation, 

  dcterms:educationLevel rdfs:subPropertyOf dcterms:audience .

I can conclude

  resource:X dcterms:audience _:x .

and so

  _:x rdf:type some:AgentGroup .

i.e. the value is both an AgentGroup and an Education Levels Statement.
I find it hard to imagine a case where that makes sense :-( 

So I think either 

(a) the subproperty assertion is wrong and should be withdrawn or 
(b) the definition of educationLevel needs to be amended so that its
values are "classes of entity....", which Stuart suggested was the
intent [1]

However as I said back at [2] I suspect that current use of
dcterms:educationLevel probably includes values that are either
"statements" or "levels" and not just "classes of entity..." :-(

Subject:      Is dcterms:educationLevel a subproperty of dcterms:audience?

Having had a few queries about element refinements recently
(partly as a result of the document currently out for review
on the AB list), I've been looking at some of the current
DCMI subproperty assertions, and I've ended up asking myself:

Is it correct to describe dcterms:educationLevel as a
subproperty/refinement of dcterms:audience (N.B. as both of
these properties are currently defined) ?

dcterms:educationLevel 
====================== 

Definition : A general statement describing the education or
training context. Alternatively, a more specific statement
of the location of the audience in terms of its progression
through an education or training context.

dcterms:audience 
================ 

Definition: A class of entity for whom the resource is intended
or useful.

Comment: A class of entity may be determined by the creator
or the publisher or by a third party.

Is it the case that: 

for every statement (1) x dcterms:educationLevel y 

it is also true that (2) x dcterms:audience y 

? 

I really don't think it _is_ the case, and I'm really
uneasy about that subproperty assertion. If the value
in statement (1) is a "general statement...." or a "more
specific statement...." (which is what the definition of
dcterms:educationLevel says it should be), I can not see how
that value can also be "a class of entity...".

For example, I think the definition of dcterms:educationLevel
permits me to say

x dcterms:educationLevel "This resource is for beginner
guitarists."

The subproperty assertion then allows me to infer 

x dcterms:audience "This resource is for beginner guitarists." 

But that value is not "a class of entity...."; it's a
statement. 

Now, yes, it may be a statement which includes
some information _about_ a class of entity, but that is
not the same thing. I know, I know, that must seem like the
most awful nit-picking, and a human reader might manage the
distinction, but subproperty assertions are designed to be
used by software applications, and an application which is
expecting the value to be "A class of entity" will _not_
manage that inferred statement correctly. 

(And in fact, the decision _not_ to assert that
dcterms:rightsHolder was a subproperty of dc:rights was taken
precisely to avoid ending up with the reverse situation,
and supporting inferences that an entity - a value of
dcterms:rightsHolder - was "information about rights held...",
which is what dc:rights says its values should be.) 

Now then, it may be that the intent with dcterms:educationLevel
really was/is that values are "classes of entity" and
indeed the examples in the term proposal [1] ("Grade 5" =
the class of students at that Grade; "Preschool" = the class
of preschool children) do seem to hint this is the case. 

But (IMHO) the current definitions of the properties do make
the subproperty assertion problematic. :-( 

(Sorry!)
