Ann: We've recently completed and published the Dublin Core Application 
Profile (DCAP) for Web Resource Discovery in the Government of Canada.  
In it we decided to use the "created" refinement for date completed.  
Our comment states "In the Government of Canada, the Created refinement 
indicates the date the content of the resource was completed for its 
intended purpose."  Since this application profile is for the web 
resource discovery only (not records management, content management, or 
other purposes) we felt that that if a user knows the original date of 
an annual report, law, brochure, etc. - regardless of when it was posted 
on the web - then that date should be the completed date.  We used the 
"issued" refinement for the date resource was originally posted to the 
web.

We didn't include "date received" in the DCAP - it doesn't seem 
pertinent to web resource discovery. 

Here's a link to our DCAP:
