Colleagues,

We would like to alert members of this list to some forthcoming 
JISC-funded work to develop a Dublin Core Application Profile for 
describing scholarly publications (eprints) held in institutional 
repositories. This work is being undertaken within the JISC Digital 
Repositories programme and is being coordinated by Julie Allinson 
(UKOLN, University of Bath) and Andy Powell (Eduserv Foundation).  A 
small working group has been assembled and will meet in early June to 
begin work.

Further information is available at the following URL:
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Application_Profile

Working papers will also be available from this location as they become 
available.

We welcome any comments or suggestions relating to this work, 
particularly any pointers to requirements or existing application 
profiles in this area.

Thanks,

Julie Allinson (UKOLN)
Andy Powell (Eduserv Foundation)
