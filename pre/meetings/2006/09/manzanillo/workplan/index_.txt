        -- DCAM issues
           http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/AMIssues

   1.2. DC-RDF updated to reflect changes in DCAM

        -- Legacy specs - not yet superseded:
           -- Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF/XML - title/date/status

              http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCXMLRevision/Comments

        The Working Draft of 2006-05-29 is intended to be replaced by two new documents:

        -- Expressing Dublin Core metadata using XML (DC-XML-Min)
           http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCXMLRevision/DCXMLMGuidelines/2006-09-18
        
           -- DC-XML-Min Instances
              http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCXMLRevision/DCXMLMInstances/2006-09-18
        
        -- Expressing Dublin Core metadata using XML (DC-XML-Full)
           http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCXMLRevision/DCXMLFGuidelines/2006-09-18
           Supports serialization of full DCAM description model.

           -- DC-XML-Full Instances
              http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCXMLRevision/DCXMLFInstances/2006-09-18

        DC-XML-Min and DC-XML-Full are intended to replace the
        legacy DC-in-XML Guidelines as DCMI Recommendations.

        -- http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCText/

2. Usage Board meeting in Mexico

   2.1. DCMES Editorial changes - finalization

        -- Public comment Aug 28 to Sep 25
           http://dublincore.org/usageboard/2006/2006-06.dcmes/dcmes-changes/ 

   2.2. Assignment of Domains and Ranges - meeting packet to include:

        -- Draft issues page:
           http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2006/09/manzanillo/domains-ranges/html/index.html
           This page includes links to past discussions on
           DC-USAGE, to Swoogle statistics, and to relevant
           notes and postings from the DC-RDF comment period.

        -- http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/PropertyDomainsAndRanges
           ACTION Usage Board (Mexico meeting): check draft
                  Domain/Range Vocabulary term-by-term (all
                  /terms/ properties); determine which definitions 
                  or range assignments will need more attention.

        -- New version of DCAM - relevant for SES/VES discussion:
           http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/AMDraftUpdate

        -- 2006-06-28 DC-Arch proposal: new ranges only for the "terms" namespace? 
           http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0606&L=dc-architecture&P=5526

        -- Encoding Schemes as SES or VES - basis for discussion is
           http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2005/09/madrid/files/2005-05-12.encoding-scheme-types.txt

           ACTION Usage Board (Mexico meeting): For each Encoding
           Scheme, decide whether it is a Vocabulary Encoding
           Scheme or a Syntax Encoding Scheme (starting points are
           proposal above and new draft DCAM).

        -- ACTION Usage Board (Mexico meeting): Agree on
           further process for finalizing Domains and Ranges
           in all of its aspects (declaration of classes,
           assignment as domains and ranges, implications
           for term documentation).

   2.3. Review Collection Description Application Profile

           compatibility with previous XML guidelines.  See:
           http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0609&LUe-ARCHITECTURE&P=150
           http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0609&LUe-ARCHITECTURE&P=255

        -- DC-XML may need to distinguish between dc-xml-full and dc-xml-minimal:
           http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0606&L=dc-architecture&P=1019

   4.3. Raise awareness in broader community, prepare for formal review in early 2007

       -- Guidelines on How to declare a set of metadata terms
       -- Guidelines on How to make a DCAP 
          -- following example of CDAP, possibly later also 
             ePrints, etc
          -- Call for Tender to require "close coordination with
             the editors of DCAM"
          -- Include Simple Dublin Core as stand-alone example
