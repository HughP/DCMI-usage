    --  Task: Prepare a short review of ACore for discussion

Errata and other changes to DCMI terms documentation (Akira)
    http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2009/10/seoul/.html/errata.html
        This document includes some proposals to be decided formally 
        at the meeting (and documents some decisions already and in 
        the queue for publication).  After the Seoul meeting, this will
        be turned into a single decision document.

    http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/2008/2008-09-21.berlin-5Etc.html
        The meeting notes for Berlin record the discussion of the literal
        range for Title and Alternative title.

    --  Task: Carefully check all of the proposed changes.
        Write a very short summary of the rationale for assigning
        a literal range to Title and Alternative title (using the 
        meeting notes above.

    --  Task: Follow dc-architecture discussion regarding
        DC creator and FOAF maker and summarize discussion to
        dc-usage by Friday, 2 October.  Prepare bullet points
        for discussing other issues (see above) in order to
        identify topics for further discussion in the Usage
        Board.  Propose a one-paragraph glossary entry for
        "Simple Dublin Core" for discussion.  Could Agent Roles
        be discussed in a short glossary entry?

    http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2009/10/seoul/.html/usingdc.html

    --  Task: In Seoul, we will not have time to discuss all of the 
        examples for elements and qualifiers in Using Dublin Core.
        Rather, the task here is to prepare bullet points on general
        issues related to the examples, for example the issue of
        literal versus non-literal values.  Prepare to discuss possible
        ways forward for Using Dublin Core: what would need to be done
        in order to bring the document up to date?  Is a document at
        this level needed, and what is its audience?

Glossary (Joe)
    http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/glossary.shtml
        "Using Dublin Core - Part 7: DCMI Glossary" 
    http://dublincore.org/beta/glossary/
        Tom proposes that the glossary be written as a relatively short
        document covering only major concepts that are characteristic of
        Dublin Core metadata.  The glossary is potentially a good place to
        explain legacy issues, such as "dumb down" and "document-like object".
    Candidate issues for inclusion (or summary) in a glossary:
        http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2009/10/seoul/.html/dumbdown.html
        http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2009/10/seoul/DumbDownNotes.htm
        http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2009/10/seoul/.html/dlo.html
        http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2009/10/seoul/IssuesWithCoverage.htm

    --  Task: Identify which of the terms in the old glossary
        are most important for describing the "Dublin Core style"
        of metadata.  For those most important terms, suggest bullet
        points for what a modern glossary entry should say.  Flag any
        obvious gaps -- DC terminology that would need to be covered
        in a glossary, such as the "candidate issues" above (and suggest
        bullet points).
