All,

Following is my draft of Note for dcterms:title and
dcterms:alternative in the "Terms" document.

Note: In October 2009, DCMI specified the range as literal,
though there are some important uses with non-literal values of
"title".  Main reasons are 1) Most applications use "title"
with literal values, 2) Literal range makes implementation
greatly simple.  Those who want non-literal values can use
leagacy http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title.
