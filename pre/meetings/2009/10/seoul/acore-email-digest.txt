2009-01-12 From Martin Leese < DELETED > to dc-general

Sorry if this has been discussed before, but I couldn't
find it in the archives.  What happened to the
Administrative Dublin Core (A-Core)?

I have a personal website, and implemented DC on it
in 2001.  Revamping the metadata has finally reached
the top of my to-do list.  Looking on the DC website,
in the intervening seven years there have been a
number of changes.  The biggest, for my simple use,
is the absence of A-Core.  Can I still use this?

I have been using the following elements from it:=20
    AC.activity (created)
    AC.name
    AC.email

The other big change, from my point of view, is
Qualified DC.  I can see that this will be most useful.

    A-Core never really took off and in comparison with other standards is
    of limited use. AGLS looked at this issue last year and decided to adapt
    the administrative metadata in ISO 19115 (Geographic information -
    Metadata). The terms are being implemented in a namespace called
    adminterms. I can post a reference description if there is any interest.

2009-01-12 From Douglas Campbell <Douglas.Campbell@NATLIB.GOVT.NZ>

    That would be great. 

    I don't have ISO 19115 to hand, but from what I can see it has:
    - file id for the metadata record
    - language used in metadata record
    - character set used in metadata record
    - parent metadata record id
    - contact details for creator of metadata record
    - date metadata record was last updated
    - schema (and version) used in the metadata record (eg. MARC, ISO 19115)
    All the other elements in ISO 19115 seem to refer to the described =
    resource rather than the metadata record itself.

    Features from Admin Core [1] missing include:
    - location (eg. URI) of metadata record
    - rights ownership over the metadata record
    - handling specification
    - activities performed on the metadata record
    - source database

    We still use Admin Core, especially ac:rights, under the recommended =
    namespace http://purl.org/ac/ [2]

    They are basically describing the metadata record as a resource in itself, so
    they could very well use dcterms to do that.

    fileIdentifier       = dcterms:identifier
    metadataLanguage     = dcterms:language (but really unnecessary if
    xml:lang is used with string values)
    metadataContact      = dcterms:contributor
    dateStamp            = dcterms:created
    metadataUpdateDate   = dcterms:modified
    metadataStandardName = dcterms:conformsTo
    metadataCharacterSet = ?

    The others are just duplications of dcterms properties
    /about/ a metadata record.

    Issue: When one does not want to give an identifier to a
    metadata and wants to ship metametadata and metadata in the
    same XML record.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2009-02-05 From Mikael Nilsson <mikael@NILSSON.NAME>

    A similar situation arises in LOM-DCAM, and an approach very like the
    one you propose is used there now. The same properties are used in
    distinct descriptions, and all is well.

    > fileIdentifier       = dcterms:identifier
    > metadataLanguage     = dcterms:language (but really unnecessary if
    > xml:lang is used with string values)
    > metadataContact      = dcterms:contributor

    or even publisher?

    > dateStamp            = dcterms:created
    > metadataUpdateDate   = dcterms:modified
    > metadataStandardName = dcterms:conformsTo
    > metadataCharacterSet = ?

    most containers (such as XML) will solve that problem anyway - so mostly
    unnecessary.

    > not wanting to ship metametadata and metadata in the same XML record.

    I don't think there's an issue - if it's an XML language they design
    themselves:

    1. There's no need to give an identifier for the metadata record in
    order to separate the two descriptions. One can just do

    <metametadata>
      <dcterms:whatever>....
    </metametadata>
    <metadata>
      <dcterms:whatever>...
    <metadata>

    2. If they don't even want to create two separate containers, they can
    just use the dcterms definitions, but come up with their own XML element
    names and separate into records based on XML names. GRRDL can do that.

    <metadata>
      <creator> dfgsdfg <creator> <!-- creator of the resource -->
      <meta-creator> sdfsdf </meta-creator> <!-- creator of the metadata -->
    </metadata>

    ---> GRDDL --->

    _:resource <dcterms:creator> _:creator .
    _:creator <rdf:value> "dfgsdfg" .


    _:record <dcterms:creator> _:mcreator .
    _:mcreator <rdf:value> "sdfsdf" .

    This still results in level 2 interop, so all is well. There are many
    other ways to accomplish this.
