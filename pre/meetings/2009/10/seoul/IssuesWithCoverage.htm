<p>
This discussion of issues with dcterms:coverage follows on a discussion at an August 2007 meeting of the Usage Board in Singapore - see [1]. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Because of the problem between 'coverage' on the one hand and 'spatial' and 'temporal' on the other. We have two problems: 
</p>
<p>
* 1.  overlap between subject and coverage * 2.  subproperty relations between spatial/temporal and coverage 
</p>
<p>
We have four courses of action: 
</p>
<p>
* 1. delete assertion spatial/temporal subproperty of coverage [problem for legacy and namespace policy] 
</p>
<p>
* 2. change definition of spatial/temporal to fit coverage [problem for namespace policy] 
</p>
<p>
* 3. do nothing and accept that spatial/temporal are not really subproperties 
</p>
<p>
* 4. introduce a new coverage or recommend spatial/temporal instead 
</p>
<p>
NOTED: 2004 definition of 'coverage' was significantly different from 2007 -- and we may have introduced a problem in the change in 2007 i.e., constraining 'coverage' by using the word 'topic' 
</p>
<p>
NOTED: DCMI might want to build an AP that ameliorates the legacy problems of 1.1 and TERMS -- 'coverage', 'identifier', 'source', etc. -- this needs to be linked to discussion and decision of the AP of Simple DC. 
</p>
<p>
AGREED: 'spatial' and 'temporal' subproperty assertions are inconsistent with the definition of 'coverage'.

* Comment: Spatial topic and spatial applicability may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates.  Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range.  A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies.  Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN].  Where appropriate, named places or time periods can be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.

* Definition: The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant. * Comment: Spatial topic may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates. Temporal period may be a named period, date, or date range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]. Where appropriate, named places or time periods can be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.

* Definition: The extent or scope of the content of the resource. * Comment: Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name or geographic coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity). Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN] and that, where appropriate, named places or time periods be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.
