Okay, in fact I think I'll change the text a bit. It is now:
"This encoding scheme represents the alternative provided
in ISO 8601 that does not include hyphens as separators
between year, month, and day."

change to:

"This encoding scheme represents the alternative form specified in ISO
8601 as 'basic format', which does not include hyphens as separators
between year, month, and day."

References
Note that it is a problem that ISO does not provide free access to its
documents. However, I have bookmarked the final draft of the 2000 revision
to ISO 8601 which explains the different alternatives. I recommend
including it as a reference:

1. ISO 8601:2000
Representation of dates and times, second edition
Final draft, as edited and published by the ISO/CS
http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf
(alternatives detailed in 5.2.1.1)

2. Date and Time Formats
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
This note defines a profile of ISO 8601, which specifies the "extended
format" representation, i.e. inclusion of hyphens between year, month and
day.

3. XML Schema: Datatypes (Appendix D: ISO 8601 Date and Time Formats)
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats
This W3C recommendation is part 2 of the specification of the XML Schema
language and provides more detail on ISO formats.

Did you see Douglas Campbell's comments on the dc-date list?

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0409&L=dc-date&T=0&F=&S=&P=395

I think it needs to be absolutely clear whether the encoding scheme is
intended to permit all of the options available in ISO8601.

These two references may muddy the waters slightly:

http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime W3CDTF permits only a subset of
ISO8601 (That's where we came in!)

http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats The XML Schema datatypes
also appear to diverge from ISO8601:

====
It should be pointed out that the datatypes described in this
specification do not cover all the types of data covered by [ISO 8601],
nor do they support all the lexical representations for those types of
data.
====

So if these links are included, I think it needs to be clear what their
inclusion signifies with regard to the encoding scheme.

The intent was only to allow the expression of date using what they call
the "basic format", i.e. without hyphens. It is not supposed to address
other permutations or date ranges. ISO doesn't really have separate
designations for these various options. We could consider a different
designation? Like "ISO 8601 basic" or ISO8601B. But we'll be making it up.

Douglas Campbell's message talks particularly about date ranges, which
hasn't been covered by DCMI. It was an issue in the DC-Lib AP.

Right. The representation with hyphens separating YYYY and MM and DD etc.

I only put it in because Tom told me to, but I don't really think it's all
that relevant to the discussion, so would just as well leave it out. More
confusing than anything.

Yes, but we _are_ making up the name anyway ;-)

Douglas' instinctive assumption (and mine, initially, to be honest!) was
that dcterms:ISO8601 would mean _any_ format permitted by ISO8601.

"The thing with dcterms:ISO8601 is that if you're going to call it that,
surely it can really only mean ISO 8601 in its entirety."

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0409&L=dc-date&T=0&F=&S=&P=659

I wasn't certain what the plan was, but I did say it was dangerous to
make that assumption, and you shouldn't read too much into a name:

"Well, I'd argue that dcterms:ISO8601 or more properly
http://purl.org/dc/terms/ISO8601 is just a name.

What that name/URIref denotes is up to the Usage Board to say. I agree
that it might be confusing, but there's no reason they can't say it
denotes some subset of the dates available under ISO8601."

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0409&L=dc-date&T=0&F=&S=&P=797

But having said that, I do have some sympathy with Douglas' position,
especially given that (AFAIK) DC doesn't impose any similar
"qualifications" (!) in the definitions of our other terms that
reference other specs and standards: the references to the RFCs and
other ISO standards just mean "the value space as defined in RFCxxx or
ISOxxx".

So if DC does impose some caveats here, it has to be very clear.

So, to be absolutely clear on this issue, can I just ask whether this
new encoding scheme (whatever it is called) permits date ranges or not?

I think so, yes.

According to the notes in the Bath meeting packet
(http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/03/ISSUES/registration-proposals/),
the additions were suggested by Roland and agreed to by
Rebecca:

Since the original decision to approve ISO8601 was made fifteen
months ago, and finalization of the wording has proved to
be more difficult than expected, I think we should discuss
the proposal in Shanghai in the context of the broader issues
which have arisen with regard to date, then we should re-vote
to approve "ISO8601".
