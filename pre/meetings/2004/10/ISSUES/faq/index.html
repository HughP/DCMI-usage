Shepherd: Diane

The AskDCMI service [1] was discussed in Bath [2], and there
was an action on Diane to pull important questions and extant
answers from AskDCMI and post to the UB list as the basis
for a new FAQ.  

In Bath, the Usage Board responded favorably to a proposal to
have UB members "shepherd" individual, URI-citable answers in
a completely revised FAQ.  One would need to bear in mind that
not every "Frequently Asked Question" is within the scope of
the Usage Board.  Some issues are clearly within the scope of
the Directorate (e.g., related to DCMI as an organization).
Others are related to Architecture, though there is no
Architecture Board that could take responsibility here.
The Directorate should therefore consider how ownership of
this crucial but long-neglected document might be managed.

As of September, Diane reports that she has not made progress
with this work item.

In Shanghai, Diane proposes to discuss the following:

-- Short tour of the new software that runs AskDCMI.
   It includes a number of significant fixes that should reduce
   some of the barriers that members of the Usage Board have
   identified as issues with the current version.

-- Asking whether this service is worth continuing

-- If no, how could we shut it down in an orderly fashion with
   the fewest lingering problems? What will we suggest to users
   as a substitute? DC-General?

-- If yes, how can we do better answering questions in a
   timely manner?  Should we expand the expert group?  How?
