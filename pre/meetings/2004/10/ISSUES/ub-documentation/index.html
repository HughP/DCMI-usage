                   the meeting packet
                   (<a href="/usage/meetings/2004/10/Meeting-packet.pdf">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/10/Meeting-packet.pdf</a>) 
                   for copies of the key documents discussed at the meeting.

As of September 2004, the UB Process document (Point 2.3.2) says: 

    All materials pointed to in the agenda are archived at
    <a href="/usage/meetings/">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/</a> after the final
    pre-meeting version of the agenda has been distributed. After
    the meeting, the archive version of the agenda is edited to
    point to these archive copies.

The best example of this is the tree of materials under:

    <a href="/usage/meetings/2004/03/ISSUES/">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/03/ISSUES/</a>

all of which are archived on the DCMI Web site and thus citable
using DCMI URLs.  This ensures that copies of all relevant
materials, "frozen" in time, will be available in future.

However, archiving all of those materials at
<a href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org</a> and editing all those URLs to point to
DCMI-archived materials is alot of work.  The alternative is
to let the PDF meeting packet -- which holds copies of all
documents relevant to a given meeting -- fulfill the function
of preservation, e.g.:

    <a href="/usage/meetings/2004/03/Bath-meeting-packet.final.pdf">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/03/Bath-meeting-packet.final.pdf</a>

In Shanghai, I would like to hear the opinion of the UB
on whether the extra work involved in archiving everything
locally is worth it in the case of UB meeting materials --
or whether it would suffice to let the PDF packet serve this 
function.
