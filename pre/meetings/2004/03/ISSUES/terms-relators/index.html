SUMMARY (Tom)

This topic seems to have three threads:

-- Ongoing discussion of what it really means when MARC
   Relator terms are declared to be semantically narrower than
   dc:contributor (see the rough-cut email excerpts below).

-- Guidelines for using Agent Roles in Dublin Core -- a draft
   prepared by Diane and Rebecca and printed in the main packet:
   <a href="/usage/meetings/2004/03/Agent-Roles-Guidelines2.txt">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/03/Agent-Roles-Guidelines2.txt</a>.

-- The mechanics of declaring machine-processably that all
   (or maybe just most!) Relator terms are
   subPropertyOf dc:contributor.  The 13-page RDF schema,
   <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf">http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf</a>, will be put
   into the supplementary packet for reference, though the
   nitty-gritty of the RDF encoding should be largely out of
   scope for our discussion in Bath.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have put up the MARC relator code list in RDF at:
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf">http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf</a>

I read over the comments about equivalent terms and decided to do the
following:

1. All relator terms have the following:
&lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor">http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor</a>" /&gt;

Meaning that it is equivalent to dc:contributor.  

    [** Note: Andy suggested that Rebecca meant to say
    "subPropertyOf dc:contributor" here. **]

2. marc.relators/cre (i.e. marc:creator) has the following statement:
&lt;owl:equivalentProperty
rdf:resource="<a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator</a>" /&gt;

This is what Roland suggested. I felt that this was better than sameAs,
since I understood this to be a weaker equivalence. Because marc:creator
and dc:creator have different semantics, I thought this was safer.

3. I made no statement about equivalence between marc:publisher and
dc:publisher, because the relator terms only are used when the entity
functions as a publisher that makes contributions. dc:publisher, as has
been pointed out, makes the resource available. This term indicates
contributions to the resource in the context of also being a publisher. So
marc:publisher just has the statement as above concerning its equivalence
to dc:contributor.

We can discuss this further at the UB meeting in Seattle and any other
issues about implementing these terms as refinements of dc:contributor.

FYI: the above URL will be changed at some point in the future when we set
up a namespace for the relators.

Yes, I think the important thing to remember is that we decided to
include all roles on the LC relator list so that implementers could
make the choice of what to use, rather than US having to anticipate
their needs.  I think when we get to the point of expressing our
decision and how people ought to use these terms, the idea that the
choices are theirs needs to be made.

The issue is NOT, whether they CAN be contributors in some cases,
but whether they ARE contributors in all possible cases.

marc:publisher as you put it in NOT redundant to a
dc:publisher.  A dc:publisher is allowed simply to make a
resource available as is and is not a priori supposed to
contribute to it's content.

&gt; They will add other terms
&gt; from the MARC relator list where necessary to bring out a particular role
&gt; in relation to the resource. If they're using MARC they'll use
&gt; marc:publisher (in the way it's used in MARC, which is as a value of a
&gt; relator element associated with the name). My understanding is that we are
&gt; adding these subProperty statements for machine readability, but I don't
&gt; imagine people will get confused.

Information systems will DRAW AUTOMATIC conclusions from
subProperty relations.  It is important to get subProperty
relations right.

There remain issues with the use of MARC relator codes - and these have
recently surfaced on the DC Collection Description WG mailing list.

The CD WG need a property to indicate the owner of the resource (in this
case a collection).  The use of marc:own was discussed.  marc:own is
defined to be a refinement of dc:contributor.  However, in this case, the
owner will not necessarily have made a contribution to the collection.
They may simply have bought the collection for example. Therefore, the WG
will have to find an alternative to marc:own.

So, two things...

1) The definition of marc:own at

 <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf">http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf</a>

needs to make it crystal clear that in this case, 'owner' is defined to be
an owner that has made contributions to the content of the resource.
I.e., the defintion of marc:own should be changed to something like

 The person or organization that currently owns and has made a
 contribution to the content of the item or collection.

2) In many cases WGs and other groups will have to find alternatives to
the MARC relator codes because the restrictive definitions (as having made
a contribution) are not intuitive and are too narrow for many uses.

Subject: Re: Guidelines for the use of Roles
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was going to say I fully agree with Andy's comments below, especially
the first point about the need to make it explicit in the textual
definitions of these properties that they imply that the object of the
property is an entity that contributes to the content of the resource.

But looking at the list of properties more closely, it seems to me that
there are cases where saying that they are a sub-property of
dc:contributor introduces an element of contradiction:

e.g. <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators/dub">http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators/dub</a>

Label = "Dubious author"
Comment = "A person or corporate body to which authorship has been
dubiously or incorrectly ascribed."

So in making a statement using this sproperty, on the one hand you
assert that authorship has been dubiously or incorrectly ascribed, but
at the same time you say that they are "An entity responsible for making
contributions to the content of the resource" (!)

Yes, I can just about see that you _can_ assert that their claim to
_authorship_ is dubious, and also assert that they still made some other
contribution to the content, without contradicting yourself.

But in practice this seems to limit the legitimate use of the property
to the extent that it is almost useless in any practical sense.

I'm probably re-opening a can of worms, but I'll do it anyway: why is it
necessary to declare all of these things as sub-properties of
dc:contributor? It seems to me that many of them make perfectly useful
properties without asserting any relationship to dc:contributor (and
indeed asserting that relationship only serves to limit their
usefulness).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess it's because there was the argument that if we
use these roles with a DC element, that DC element being
contributor, it has to refine the semantics of the element. So
I was told we had to put that statement in for each of the role
terms on our list (which didn't originally have anything of
the sort). And I followed instructions, although we wouldn't
be having these arguments about the use of the terms if they
didn't make these assertions. So we have a list of stable,
standardized terms for roles, but there seems to be this
argument that we can't use them if they don't exactly fit
in with the semantics of contributor. Maybe the way out is
to consider the word "contributions" as broad and inclusive
of indirect types of contributions. Maybe the problem is
the choice of words we used for elements in the original
DCMES. (I'm sure you'll all love that statement.)

&gt; will have to find an alternative to marc:own.

marc:own says that it's a refinement of dc:contributor because we were
told this had to be done to be able to use these terms.

All of these terms were initially included in the relators list because an
institution thought they played a large enough role in connection with a
resource to warrant having access to it by that entity's name. Thus, we
concluded that this is a form of contribution. In the case of owner, the
relationship to the resource is that the named entity is an owner and this
role is important to the given resource. So it is a very broad definition
of "contributor". We don't actually call them contributors as such in
MARC, which was what this list was defined for, but consider them making a
contribution to the resource in an indirect way.  So for any situation
where "owner" is the role that an entity played in the resource, it would
be the type of resource for which ownership is important (probably rare
material that might not be identified any other way).

&gt; So, two things...
&gt;
&gt; 1) The definition of marc:own at
&gt;
&gt;  <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf">http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/marcrelcodes.rdf</a>
&gt;

&gt; the MARC relator codes because the restrictive definitions (as having made

I'm not sure I understand this comment. The MARC definitions are not
currently so narrow (as I described above). Adding something like what you
suggest to the definition will make them narrower than they were
intended. That could affect existing usage and invalidate existing
records. So I don't think we will want to narrow these definitions in
this way.

&gt; Right. So that narrowness is _not_ present in the initial MARC relator

Good.  I'm glad that we seem to have clarified this at last.

&gt; But making the statement (as the declaration sof the RDF properties do):
&gt;
&gt; marcrel:own rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:contributor .
&gt;
&gt; does effectively generate this narrowing, I think.

Yes, that's right.  Declaring some of these relators as being
sub-properties of dc:contributor does narrow their intended semantics.

&gt; Well, strictly speaking, what it says is, every time I say:
&gt;
&gt; _x marcrel:own _y . (Resource x has-an-owner Entity y)
&gt;
&gt; I also imply:
&gt;
&gt; _x dc:contributor _y .  (Resource x has-an-entity-that-made-a
&gt; contribution-to-the content Entity y)
&gt;
&gt; Which I don't think you really want to say.

Agreed.

&gt; I take your point that you can argue that the entities related to a
&gt; resource by a MARC relator property do "make a contribution" to the
&gt; resource in the very general sense you describe above. But (it seems to
&gt; me) they do not necessarily do so in the specific sense of
&gt; dc:contributor.

Agreed.

&gt; Now we might well argue that's a problem with the definition of
&gt; dc:contributor (as I think you suggest in your subsequent message). But
&gt; working on the basis of the current definition of dc:contributor, it
&gt; seems to me that stating the subproperty relation creates an undesirable
&gt; result in many cases.

Agreed.

&gt; So it seems to me the problem is with the constraint that:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; marc:own says that it's a refinement of dc:contributor
&gt; &gt; because we were told this had to be done to be able to use
&gt; &gt; these terms.

Well, somewhere along the line, this whole process seems to have got very
confused... which is all water under the bridge, so probably best
forgotten?

The important thing to recognise is that the MARC properties can be used
irrespective of whether or not they refine DC properties.  And indeed,
they become much more useful if they are not tied to DC properties in an
inappropriate way.

&gt; It seems to me that it makes perfect sense to describe some of these
&gt; relator terms as refinements of dc:contributor, but for others it does
&gt; not. And that decision has to be taken on a case-by-case basis not on a
&gt; one-rule-for-all. But even for those relator terms that are not
&gt; refinements of dc:contributor, it's still useful for LoC to declare them
&gt; as RDF properties so that applications can use them: they just have
&gt; nothing to do with dc:contributor. That's OK, isn't it?

Yes.  So... I think the best course of action is to go thru the current
LoC RDF schema declaration for these terms and do the following:

- remove rdfs:subPropertyOf assertions where it is not appropriate, e.g.
  for marc:own
- add explicit owl:samePropertyAs assertions w.r.t. dc:creator,
  dc:publisher and dc:contributor (there are one or two of these but I
  suspect there could be more, e.g. marc:aut == dc:creator)

Then we'll have a much more useful set of new properties that don't make
wrong or confusing assertions about their relationship to existing DC
properties... and which then can be used by other initiatives like the DC
Collection Description WG.

Is there any reason not to change the RDFS in this way?  I am happy to
have a stab at making the changes to the LoC RDFS, but probably better for
someone at LoC to do it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, to clarify, if you have a MARC relator term that is NOT a refinement
of Contributor, then you just use it without any relation to a DC term? We
don't have this problem with semantics in either MARC or MODS because the
element we use it with is called "name", which is much broader than DC
creator or contributor. In other words, DC has no element that is a name
associated with a resource, but those elements stipulate specific roles
related to the resource that are inherent in their semantics. I guess this
is really the problem. I haven't been following the collection description
work, but if there were a resource description and you wanted to include
the owner, you would use DC elements for everything except that and use
marc:own (or whatever we decide) for the owner's name?

I think what Andy suggests is appropriate. I could work with Andy to do
this. Andy, let's talk about how best to get this accomplished.

&gt; Yes, that's right.  Declaring some of these relators as being
&gt; sub-properties of dc:contributor does narrow their intended semantics.

If the intended semantics is as aluded to above, the
declaration is counter productive and will yield unexpected
results in retrieval (narrow minded people would say "wrong
results").

I'm kind of surprised to read that the MARC relators have a
broader semantics.  When we discussed the issue last time
concerns i had were dismissed on the basis, that narrower
semantics is understood, just not explicitly stated till now.

&gt; &gt; Well, strictly speaking, what it says is, every time I say:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; _x marcrel:own _y . (Resource x has-an-owner Entity y)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also imply:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; _x dc:contributor _y .  (Resource x has-an-entity-that-made-a

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which I don't think you really want to say.

The information given previously was exactly opposite.

&gt; &gt; Now we might well argue that's a problem with the definition of
&gt; &gt; dc:contributor (as I think you suggest in your subsequent message).

When you want to have a different semantics go ahead, provide a
definition for a new dc term and advertise it.

&gt; Well, somewhere along the line, this whole process seems to have got very
&gt; confused... which is all water under the bridge, so probably best

Back to A ?

&gt; The important thing to recognise is that the MARC properties can be used
&gt; irrespective of whether or not they refine DC properties.  And indeed,
&gt; they become much more useful if they are not tied to DC properties in an
&gt; inappropriate way.

We have to take care of the dc vocabulary. We can say,
we find the asserted relation inappropriate and suggest to delete it.

&gt; &gt; But even for those relator terms that are not
&gt; &gt; refinements of dc:contributor, it's still useful for LoC to declare them
&gt; &gt; as RDF properties so that applications can use them: they just have
&gt; &gt; nothing to do with dc:contributor.

Certainly it is useful to have well coined and structured
vocabularies for use in RDF.

It's our bussiness to further promote DC vocabulary in this area.

&gt; Yes.  So... I think the best course of action is to go thru the current
&gt; LoC RDF schema declaration for these terms and do the following:
&gt;
&gt; - remove rdfs:subPropertyOf assertions where it is not appropriate, e.g.

&gt;   dc:publisher and dc:contributor (there are one or two of these but I

Not to use owl "sameAs"  we decided previously.

NOTE: Property equivalence is not the same as property equality.
Equivalent properties have the same "values" (i.e., the same property
extension), but may have different intensional meaning (i.e., denote
different concepts). Property equality should be expressed with the
owl:sameAs construct. As this requires that properties are treated as
individuals, such axioms are only allowed in OWL Full.

But I'm not at all sure I understand the distinction being made.

Roland, could you maybe explain the distinction with some examples of
what it would mean if we used owl:equivalentProperty and what it would
mean if we used owl:sameAs please?
