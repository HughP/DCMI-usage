<h2>Introduction and background Information</h2>

<p>The DC Rights element was added to the Dublin Core following
DC-3, in recognition of the importance of terms and conditions of
use for discovered resources. To date, it has been little utilized,
owing to the lack of standard practice concerning rights
declarations on the Internet.</p>

<p>The recent emergence of the Creative Commons as a clearinghouse
for rights declarations affords an opportunity to improve this
situation, particularly for resources that have been developed with
the intention of cost-free distribution, but whose creators wish to
formally declare various rights.</p>

<p>Creative Commons has defined several licenses from which content
rights holders may choose. Each of these licenses is unambiguously
identified with a URI that is managed as unchanging and persistent
by Creative Commons. Thus, this namespace comprises a controlled,
enumerated vocabulary of license declarations, open for use by any
party for whom their terms and conditions are judged useful.
Providing a clear method for embedding of CC license information
within the Dublin Core will reinforce the impact of both protocols.
Both CC proponents and DC adopters will benefit by having a clear
approach to formal rights declaration in a widely adopted metadata
framework on the Internet. Further, the model for such declarations
has been defined so that it is broadly useful for declaring
licenses from other sources as well, providing a general-purpose
mechanism for intellectual property declarations.</p>

<p>This proposal outlines functional requirements, discusses
alternative representations, and proposes a standard of
practice.</p>

<h2>Statement of requirements</h2>

<p>DCMI metadata currently supports the following functional
requirements, through the use of the DC Rights property:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide a simple human-readable statement of who holds rights
over a resource</li>

<li>support simple (i.e. potentially ambiguous) searches of the
form "find all resources where an entity that is named using a
simple string is likely to be a rights holder"</li>
</ul>

<p>By using appropriate conventions for the value string of
dc:rights (e.g. "(c) Copyright University of Bath, 2002") it is
possible to meet narrower functional requirements, such as "provide
a simple human-readable statement of who holds copyright over a
resource" and "support simple (i.e. potentially ambiguous) searches
of the form 'find all resources where an entity that is named using
a simple string is likely to be the copyright holder'". However,
these narrower requirements can only be met using searches based on
simple string comparisons (e.g. search for '"copyright" AND
"University of Bath"'), which is not a very robust approach.</p>

<p>The two proposals for new DCMI properties below are intended to
support the following additional functional requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support unambiguous searches of the form "find all resources
where an entity named using a simple string is a rights
holder"</li>

<li>Support unambiguous searches of the form "find all resources
where an entity that is identified using a URI is a rights
holder"</li>

<li>Provide an unambiguous statement of the license under which the
resource is made available, based on the URI associated with that
license</li>

<li>Support unambiguous searches of the form "find all resources
which are made available under the terms of the license with the
following URI"</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there may be additional requirements related to
specific kinds of rights (copyright, patent rights, database
rights, etc.). For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>support unambiguous searches of the form "find all resources
where an entity named using a simple string is the copyright
holder"</li>

<li>support unambiguous searches of the form "find all resources
where an entity that is identified using a URI is the copyright
holder"</li>
</ul>

<p>These more specific requirements are not met by the two
proposals below. However, they could be met through the proposal of
narrower sub-properties of dcterms:rightsHolder, for example
dcterms:copyrightHolder.</p>

<h2>Proposed Element Refinements</h2>

<p>There are two primary requirements for rights declaration
addressed in this proposal:</p>

<ol>
<li>identifying the license associated with a particular resource,
and</li>

<li>identifying the person or organization holding the rights.</li>
</ol>

<p>This proposal recommends the adoption of the following terms to
meet these requirements:</p>

<blockquote><i>license</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>rightsHolder</i></blockquote>

<p>The specifics of each proposed term are elucidated in the
Proposal Requirements Tables below.</p>

<h2>Impact on the "dumb-down" principle</h2>

<p>Anticipated values for the proposed elements remain useful when
stripped of their qualifiers, however, as with all such
"dumbed-down" metadata values, the results will not be
interpretable with the same degree of confidence. This is
particularly important in the treatment of rights metadata because
of the potential legal implications. A "dumbed-down" rights
statement may be incomplete, but should not mislead.</p>

<h2>Implications for other license schemes</h2>

<p>This proposal was motivated by the requirements for supporting
declaration of Creative Commons licenses, but can be similarly
applied to any set of licenses without future coordination with
DCMI or changes to DCMI metadata terms. Any party desiring to
specify and maintain licenses can take advantage of this
infrastructure.</p>

<h2>DCMI Decision Tree Supporting Information:</h2>

<h3>Clarity of semantics and expression</h3>

<p>Terms proposed in this proposal are defined with a degree of
specificity and constraint equal to, or greater than, other DCMI
terms.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the value of <i>license</i> is denoted by
a URI identifying an IPR license.</p>

<p>The <i>rightsHolder</i> term is defined in much the same manner
as any of the agent elements of DC (creator, contributor, and
publisher), with an additional constraint that the identified
entity must be able to be associated with intellectual property
rights (thereby ruling out instruments as valid values for this
term).</p>

<h3>Practicality</h3>

<p>Use of Creative Commons licenses represents a formal opportunity
for right holders to declare terms and conditions outside the
framework of commercial Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems,
and as such has the potential to have an important impact on the
development of best practice in communities managing digital
assets. In addition, the proposal is written such that licenses
other than Creative Commons licenses can be declared without
retrofitting these terms, and without requiring other organizations
or initiatives to adopt namespaces from competitive
initiatives.</p>

<p>It is expected that much commercially managed content will
increasingly be packaged within DRM systems. The current proposal
is based on the declaration of digital rights, rather than
management, and is more suitable for organizations and individuals
that want to make their content widely available, often without
compensation, but without foregoing specified rights.</p>

<p>Specifying license URIs is straightforward and unambiguous,
taking advantage of the basic Web infrastructure, and relying on
the commitment of organizations to support such infrastructure over
time.</p>

<h3>Appropriate Placement within the DC Architecture</h3>

<p>The proposed <i>license</i> term refines the Rights element,
affording a degree of specificity and constraint that make it
broadly useful for rights declaration applications. The proposed
<i>rightsHolder</i> term is not a refinement of any existing DCMI
terms. Declaring the new terms within the DCMI namespace will
simplify their interpretation by metadata applications and provide
sufficient generality to support any group that chooses to specify
licenses. No coordination with DCMI would be necessary to expand
the use of the terms by other organizations in the future, and DC
will help to establish a consistent and useful deployment framework
for the community at large.</p>

<p>An alternative to the proposed approach is to declare a Creative
Commons encoding scheme and simply register it as such, leaving the
semantics, structure, and syntax to the Creative Commons community.
This would work, but is undesirable in that there would be little
incentive for competing licensing schemes to use CC's encoding,
possibly leading to divergence in the structure, encoding, and
semantics of multiple rights declaration schemes.</p>

<p>Creative Commons is an organization that is focused on licenses,
not on the structure and encoding of the metadata about those
licenses. DCMI, in turn, has no expertise in licenses, but can
facilitate rights declaration by promoting a consistent and
flexible means for encoding declarations.</p>

<h3>Existing implementations</h3>

<p>Examples of organizations using CC licenses can be found at
http://creativecommons.org/learn/collaborators</p>

<p>Those participating include a variety of organizations that come
from traditional DCMI constituent communities.</p>

<h2>Decision Tree Table</h2>

<ol>
<li>While the specification of a Creative Commons encoding scheme
would satisfy the immediate need for declaration of a Creative
Commons license, such an approach suffers from two significant
disadvantages outlined earlier: separation of organizational
function: (a) Creative Commons is concerned with licenses, DCMI is
concerned with maintaining metadata terms, and (b) such an approach
will do nothing to promote consistent means for rights declaration
in the community at large, and hence will not come into wide use by
harvesters.</li>

<li>The use of an application profile for specification of rights
declaration suffers from precisely the same problems as encoding
schemes.</li>

<li>All valid values of the proposed <i>license</i> term will also
be valid values of the existing DC Rights term - therefore this is
proposed as an element refinement of DC Rights.</li>

<li>All valid values of the proposed <i>rightsHolder</i> term will
not be valid values for any existing DCMI term - therefore this is
proposed as a new element.</li>
</ol>
