We need to talk about dc-box and dc-point in the context of
the drafted abstract model.

The issue is, that people want/use an XML coding for the
components.

Such coding we currently cannot support in RDF, as we never
assigned URI's to the properties needed for that.

An issue related is for namespace bound XML encodings.
We never really said to which namespace those elements should
be attributed.

To support the DCSV encoding via XML Schema datatyping looks
fairly ugly to me as well, as XML Schema currently does not
support user created primitives.
