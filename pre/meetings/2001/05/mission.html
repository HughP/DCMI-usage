<h1>DCMI USAGE BOARD: MISSION AND PRINCIPLES</h1>
<p>Version: Tue Jun 12 11:37:23 MET DST 2001</p>
<p>MISSION</p>
<p>The mission of the DCMI Usage Board is to ensure an orderly evolution of metadata 
  vocabularies grounded in grammatical principle. The Usage<br>
  Board evaluates proposed vocabulary terms (or changes to existing terms) in 
  light of grammatical principle, semantic clarity, and overlap with existing 
  terms. To proposals that are accepted it assigns a specific status. The Usage 
  Committee strives for consensus, justifying its decisions and interpretations 
  in terms both of principle and of empirical practice.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION POLICY</p>
<p>The Usage Board makes available its proceedings and decisions in a publicly 
  available space on the DCMI Web site.</p>
<p>PROCESS</p>
<p>The Usage Board process is described in a separate document [1].</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The scope of the Usage Board is the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [2], plus 
  additional vocabulary terms deemed useful for discovering<br>
  resources across domains.</p>
<p>GRAMMAR</p>
<p>Dublin Core may be seen as a small language for making a particular class of 
  statements about resources. Like natural languages, it has a vocabulary of word-like 
  terms, the two classes of which -- elements and qualifiers -- function within 
  statements like nouns and adjectives; and it has a syntax for arranging elements 
  and qualifiers into statements according to a simple pattern. Optional qualifiers 
  may make the meaning of a property more definite, as in &quot;Resource has dc:date 
  dcq:revised '2000-06-13'.&quot; This grammar is described more fully in [3].</p>
<p>VOCABULARY TERMS IN GENERAL</p>
<p>Vocabulary terms in Dublin Core refer to elements, qualifiers, or terms in 
  controlled vocabularies maintained by DCMI. Vocabulary terms are uniquely defined 
  in namespaces [4].</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, a Dublin Core element or qualifier is a unique identifier 
  formed by a name (e.g., title) prefixed by the URI of the namespace in which 
  it is defined, as in http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title. In this context, 
  a namespace is a vocabulary that has been formally published, usually on the 
  Web; it<br>
  describes elements and qualifiers with natural-language labels, definitions, 
  and other relevant documentation.</p>
<p>ELEMENTS</p>
<p>An element is a property of a resource.</p>
<p>QUALIFIERS</p>
<p>Qualifiers modify the properties of Dublin Core statements by specifying, in 
  the manner of natural-language adjectives, &quot;what kind&quot; of subject, 
  date, or relation. Qualifiers currently fall into two classes: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> -- Element Refinement. An element refinement is a qualifier that makes the 
    meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares 
    the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. 
    A client that does not understand a specific element refinement term should 
    be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were 
    an unqualified (broader) element. The definitions of element refinement terms 
    for qualifiers must be publicly available.</p>
  <p> -- Encoding Scheme. Encoding schemes are pointers to contextual information 
    or parsing rules that aid in the interpretation of an element value. These 
    schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. 
    A value expressed using an encoding scheme will thus be a token selected from 
    a controlled vocabulary (e.g., a term from a classification system or set 
    of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation 
    (e.g., &quot;2000-01-01&quot; as the standard expression of a date). If an 
    encoding scheme is not understood by a client or agent, the value may still 
    be useful to a human reader. The definitive description of an encoding scheme 
    for qualifiers must be clearly identified and available for public use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DUMB-DOWN PRINCIPLE</p>
<p>The qualification of Dublin Core properties is guided by a rule known colloquially 
  as the Dumb-Down Principle. According to this rule, a client should be able 
  to ignore any qualifier and use the value as if it were unqualified. While this 
  may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (minus the 
  qualifier) must continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery. Qualification 
  is therefore supposed only to refine, not extend the semantic scope of a property.</p>
<p>APPROPRIATE VALUES</p>
<p>Best practice for a particular element or qualifier may vary by context. Definitions 
  may provide some guidance; other information may be found in the User's Guide 
  [5].</p>
