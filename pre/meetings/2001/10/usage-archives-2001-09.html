<p>&gt; Dear all,<br>

  &gt; In the context of our fast-track discussion in Tokyo, could someone<br>
  &gt; please volunteer to discuss the issue below (encoding schemes for<br>
  &gt; dc:identifier)?<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Note that in follow-up discussion, Stu felt that DCMI should register<br>
  &gt; such schemes as they come to our attention, whereas Thomas Krichel and<br>
  &gt; Ray Denenberg referred to the RFC2288 proposal to encode conventional<br>
  &gt; bibliographic identifiers as URNs [1]. The status of such proposals is<br>
  &gt; apparently tracked at [2].<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; It would be very useful if someone could summarize this issue for our<br>
  &gt; consideration and suggest some guidelines we could follow.</p>
<p>The list of registered URI schemes is at:</p>
<p> http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes</p>
<p>The list of URN NIDs is at</p>
<p> http://www.uri.net/urn-nid-status.html</p>
<p>DOI doesn't appear in either. ISBN, ISSN and SICI appear in the URN NID<br>
  list.</p>
<p>doi:10.1000/182 is a perfectly good URI. It just isn't registered.</p>
<p>It is perfectly valid to encode</p>
<p>&lt;dc:identifier scheme=&quot;URI&quot;&gt;doi:10.1000/182&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;</p>
<p>in XML (or whatever). I don't know why DOI haven't tried to register<br>
  'doi' as a valid URI scheme. Clearly, having it registered would be<br>
  preferable.</p>
<p>My gut feeling goes against DCMI becoming a registry of identifier<br>
  schemes - I think we could do without the maintenance overhead. People<br>
  already have two places to register their schemes - as a<br>
  URI scheme and/or as a URN NID. Also, there may be some syntactic<br>
  advantages (particularly in RDF) in having *all* identifiers as URIs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I guess that many 'users' of DC metadata will find</p>
<p>&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.Identifier&quot; scheme=&quot;ISBN&quot; content=&quot;1234-5678&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>much more intuitive than</p>
<p>&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.Identifier&quot; scheme=&quot;URI&quot; content=&quot;urn:isbn:1234-5678&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>I presume we could use our 'fast track' process for registering these<br>
  things? Registering a URI scheme or a URN NID is more formal and long<br>
  winded - but this may not be a bad thing as it will encourage people to<br>
  think about what they are doing. The URI and URN registration processes<br>
  are outside of our control - so there may be an issue if a scheme that DC<br>
  people want to use is refused registration for some reason.</p>
<p>Note that, I assume, all valid schemes for Identifier are also valid for<br>
  Relation and Source. During the original discussion of qualifiers I'm<br>
  pretty certain that I proposed an initial list of schemes that would have<br>
  included</p>
<p>URI<br>
  DOI<br>
  ISBN<br>
  ISSN<br>
  SICI</p>
<p>Priscilla also proposed</p>
<p>Handle<br>
  URL</p>
<p>Ann Apps and I have since proposed</p>
<p>OpenURL</p>
<p>in http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue27/metadata/</p>
<p>As I say, my gut feeling is to stick with URI and force people to register<br>
  schemes externally to DCMI, either as new URI schemes or as URN NIDs or<br>
  both. But its not a very strongly held view and I wouldn't object to<br>
  registering stuff within DCMI.</p>

  &gt; Subject: Encoding schemes for resource identifier<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Dear All,<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Currently the only endorsed encoding scheme for dc:identifier is<br>
  &gt; 'URI', and also for dc:relation and dc:source. It seems to me that<br>
  &gt; you should be able to use other global standard identifiers as<br>
  &gt; encoding schemes for these elements.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Within the bibliographic citation area it seems natural to use<br>
  &gt; identifiers like ISSN, DOI, SICI, OpenURL (possibly DOI is a URI?).<br>
  &gt; In fact, people are already using these even though they are not<br>
  &gt; endorsed by DCMI.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; I am sending this to dc-general, because I'm not sure which<br>
  &gt; working group would consider it. It may fall into the domain of dc-<br>
  &gt; citation. But I suspect there are other global identifiers in other<br>
  &gt; domains.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Interestingly, DOI and ISBN are given as examples of identifiers in<br>
  &gt; the definition of dc:identifier in the DCMES, but are not given as<br>
  &gt; qualifer encoding schemes.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Should there be a list of recommended global standard encoding<br>
  &gt; schemes, or should there be a more generic endorsement of any<br>
  &gt; global standard? Having a fixed list means it will need extension<br>
  &gt; when other standards are developed.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Best wishes,<br>
  &gt; Ann<br>
