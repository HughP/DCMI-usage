For each of the currently recommended encoding schemes we
need to determine if it is a Syntax Encoding Scheme or a
Vocabulary Encoding Scheme.

In the DCMI Abstract Model, these are defined as follows:

    Each resource may be a member of one or more classes.
    Note that where the resource is a value, the class is
    referred to as a vocabulary encoding scheme.

    Syntax encoding schemes are also known as 'datatypes'
    in some contexts.

In Washington, we need to decide on the following:

1) Whether we accept Andy's criteria for deciding on the
   type of encoding scheme and his interpretation of the
   existing encoding schemes in light of those criteria [1].

   [1] <a href="/usage/meetings/2005/05/washdc/public/2005-05-12.encoding-scheme-types.txt">http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2005/05/washdc/public/2005-05-12.encoding-scheme-types.txt</a>

2) How a decision to declare these types should be reflected
   in DCMI documentation.  Specifically, the "Type of Term"
   is currently shown in the Terms source data (which is used
   to generate Web pages and RDF schemas) for each encoding
   scheme as:

       http: //dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#encoding-scheme

   Do we want to change each of those into one of the following:

       http: //dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#vocabulary-encoding-scheme
       http: //dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#syntax-encoding-scheme

   In

       http: //dublincore.org/usage/xml/terms.xml

   Which is used to generate:

       http: //dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/
       http: //dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/
       http: //purl.org/dc/terms/

   Note that this change would trigger the creation of a new
   historical version for each encoding scheme (but with no
   consequences for term URIs).

3) Decide whether this difference needs to be further
   emphasized in DCMI documentation -- e.g., by splitting
   the section "Encoding Schemes" in the DCMI Terms document
   into separate sections on "Syntax Encoding Schemes" and
   "Vocabulary Encoding Schemes".
