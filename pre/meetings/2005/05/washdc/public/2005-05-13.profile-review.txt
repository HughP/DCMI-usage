6. Proposals for Registration of Application Profiles

    *6.1.* Sources of proposals

        *6.1.1.* DCMI working groups

            *6.1.1.1.* Existing working groups or working groups
            established for the purpose of developing proposals

        *6.1.2.* Metadata implementers

            *6.1.2.1.* Established projects or research groups 

        *6.1.3.* UB itself

    *6.2.* For the purposes of review by the Usage Board:

        *6.2.1.* The Usage Board is interested in reviewing application
        profiles that make substantial use of Dublin Core elements. The
        review of application profiles by the Usage Board serves to:

            *6.2.1.1.* analyze the usage of Dublin Core within
            significant implementations;

            *6.2.1.2.* assign a DCMI stamp of approval;

            *6.2.1.3.* promote the sharing of application profiles
            between communities; and

            *6.2.1.4.* identify new terms as candidates for inclusion in
            DCMI namespaces.

        *6.2.2.* Application profiles must provide, for each term, an
        identifier of the element set where it is defined, ideally in
        the form of URIs for individual terms.

        *6.2.3.* If the terms in an application profile describe
        anything other than generic "resources" (the typical domain of
        Dublin Core), the application profile must make this clear. This
        is particularly important if an application profile is based on
        a data model that describes multiple classes of resources, such
        as agents or collections.

        *6.2.4.* It is recommended that application profiles be prepared
        using the Dublin Core Application Profile guidelines published
        by CEN [http://www.cenorm.be/cenorm/businessdomains/
        businessdomains/isss/cwa/cwa14855.asp].

        *6.2.5.* Each application profile must provide, or point to, a
        short text that describes:

            *6.2.5.1.* The context and purposes in which the application
            profile is used or is likely to be used.

            *6.2.5.2.* The organizations or individuals involved in its
            development and a capsule history thereof.

            *6.2.5.3.* Any arrangements, policies, or intentions
            regarding the future development and maintenance of the
            application profile.

    *6.3.* Review of Application Profiles by the Usage Board

        *6.3.1.* An application profile is "well-formed" if it is
        presented in accordance with the broad and flexible requirements
        outlined above. These presentation requirements may become more
        specific as "good practice" emerges over time.

        *6.3.2.* Usage Board review focuses on the use of terms related
        to Dublin Core terms and on any data models that provide a
        context for those terms. The Usage Board is agnostic about the
        use of terms not directly related to Dublin Core; strictly
        speaking such terms are outside the scope of Usage Board review.

        *6.3.3.* The use of terms related to Dublin Core (such as
        refinements of Dublin Core elements, or Dublin Core elements
        that have been constrained for particular contexts) will be
        evaluated from the standpoint of semantic conformance,
        grammatical principle (eg, "dumb-down"), clarity, and good practice.

    *6.4.* Publication and use of Usage Board Reviews

        *6.4.1.* An application profiles that "pass" review will be
        assigned the status of 'conforming'.

            *6.4.1.1.* The status of 'conforming' indicates a Usage
            Board assessment of the application profile as of the date
            of its submission for review.

            *6.4.1.2.* Changes to already 'conforming' application
            profiles require further Usage Board review of the
            application profile in whole or in part according to the
            processes and criteria outlined in sections 6.1 through 6.3. 

        *6.4.2.* For application profiles that "pass" review, the Usage
        Board will publish a Review on a Web page for application profiles.

        *6.4.3.* Each Review will include, at a minimum:

            *6.4.3.1.* Any comments from the Usage Board on the
            application profile.

            *6.4.3.2.* Pointers to locally archived copies of the
            application profile as originally submitted and (if
            necessary) as subsequently amended in light of Usage Board
            comments.

            *6.4.3.3.* A pointer to the "latest version" of an
            application profile held by its maintainers.

    *6.5.* Review represents a form of recognition, and its URL will be
    persistent for purposes of citation.
