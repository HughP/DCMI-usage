I had an action (possibly with Diane?) to put the proposed changes to 
DCMES definitions (the changes required in order to aling the definitions 
with the DCAM) into the form of a document (at least, I think that's what 
the action was!).

I've done this and put the document in the DC RDF Taskforce's Wiki (since 
these changes are also very relevant to the work of that group).  See:

Proposed changes to DCMI property definitions
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Metadata/ProposedPropertyDefinitions

Shout if you disagree with anything and/or have any other comments.

Note that some of the proposed changes go a bit beyond a simple 
interpretation of what the DCAM says!

The comment for dc:coverage includes

===
Coverage includes spatial location (a place name or geographic
coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date range) or
jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity).
===

I'm not sure "a place name" or (a set of) "geographic coordinates" _is_
a spatial location. I think they are means of
identifying/describing/representing/labelling a spatial location. Same
for "a period label".

I think the form "named adminstrative entity" gets it right - the value
is the entity, not its name.

So maybe

"a place name" -> "a named place"  
"geographic coordinates" -> "a location specified by (a set of?)
geographic coordinates"
"a period label" -> "a named period"

Or rephrase the text in brackets to say "represented by [the
names/labels etc]". 

Either way works as long as they are consistent, I think.

The comment for dc:source includes

===
The present resource may be derived from the Source resource in whole or
in part. Recommended best practice is to identify the referenced
resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal
identification system.
===

This uses both "the Source resource" (yuk!) and "the referenced
resource" to refer to the same thing, the value - maybe clearer to
settle on "the referenced resource" (which is the form used in the
descriptions of subprops of dc:relation, I think?)

Also this and some of the other DCMES definitions talk about "the
present resource" whereas the subprops of dc:relation talk about "the
described resource" - the latter seems a bit more in keeping with the
DCAM?

The comment for dc:rights includes

===
If the Rights element is absent...
===

This phrasing does seem a bit at odds with the DCAM. I think it reflects
a view in which "elements" are components in instances (as in XML (or
LOM?)). But the DCAM has no view of "elements" being "present in" or
"absent from" descriptions. A description contains statements _referring
to_ the property or it doesn't. 

So I think this should really say something like (though neither of
these seem quite right either!):

> In the absence of a statement using the Rights property....

or maybe

> In the absence of a Rights statement....

(though I recognise "Rights statement" might have other connotations)  

> I would recommend changing all usage of "[intellectual] content of the
resource" to "resource" in the definitions

I notice that you haven't proposed a change to the definition of
dc:subject ("The topic of the content of the resource.") Not sure if
that was deliberate?

I've only explicitly proposed removing "[intellectual] content of the" in 
those cases where I was making changes to the term for other reasons.  I 
missed subject off the list of possible problems by accident.  I've 
now added it.  Thanks.

I also note from the Washington minutes that the label for Subject was

Andy,

It was probably me, but whoosh, the summer has flown by.  In any 
case, thanks for following through on these--and in general I agree 
with your suggestions (with Pete's additions).  I have a comment 
about Coverage, however.

I'm a bit wary of using "topic" here, since it creates potential 
confusion with Subject. I would prefer "scope" (and I'm not sure why 
you think that creates a conflict with format and extent?) since 
there's not necessarily an "aboutness" implied for coverage that the 
word "topic" suggests. Particularly with the comment about 
jurisdictional coverage, "topic" is problematic. I'd be willing to 
compromise with "scope or topic" if necessary ... ;-)

Particularly because many of our users come to DC from MARC, this is 
an issue that comes up over and over. MARC handles the differences 
between "topic" and "scope" by placement of geographic information 
within a subject string. Resources "about" a place or time have the 
geographic or temporal piece first in the subject string; where the 
scope of the topic is limited by geographic or temporal aspects, it 
comes after the topic.  For historical reasons, we've treated 
Coverage differently, but, even so, it behooves us NOT to blur the 
difference by emphasizing only the topical uses of Coverage.

Hmmm... interesting.  I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'scope' 
here.

I thought that Coverage was to do with the 'aboutness' of the resource.

In fact, I've always worked on the basis that Coverage is, essentially, a 
sub-property of Subject.  (Though of course, as good DCers we could never 
say such a thing out loud! :-) ).

This is clearly not your view...

So, some examples.

I've always assumed that when we say

dc:coverage: bath, uk

we mean that the topic of the resource is 'bath, uk' - the resource is 
about 'bath, uk'.  And further, that we could just as well say

dc:subject: bath, uk

but we are being a little more specific by using Coverage.

Similarly, when we say

dc:coverage: 19th century

we mean that the resource is about the 19th century - i.e. the topic of 
the resource is "19th century".

What do you mean by those two statements (assuming that it isn't the same 
as my intepretation)?  I presume that you mean something different by 
'scope' (as opposed to 'topic') - something like "is only relevent in this 
context" perhaps?  So that, for example, if for some bizarre reason we 
wanted to say that a resource is "about the US, but only appropriate for 
use by people in the UK' we'd say

dc:subject: US
dc:coverage: UK

??

That certainly isn't my understanding of what Coverage is about.

Andy:

One example of what I'm talking about is where, for instance, a 
government site might have resources that apply to only a particular 
jurisdiction or sub-jurisdiction. The resources are not really 
"about" that jurisdiction or place, but the jurisdiction within which 
the resource is applicable would be indicated in Coverage. There 
might also be a Subject, which might categorize the general topic of 
the resource.  The purposes of these two elements are quite 
different, and not both relating to "aboutness" as I understand it.

On the other hand, if you have resources for tourists about that 
jurisdiction or place, they are certainly about that place.

OK, thanks.  Blimey, I think my understanding of Coverage has been wrong 
up until now! :-(  Just to confirm... if I say

dc:coverage: UK

I am *not* saying that the resource is about the UK.  Rather, I am saying 
that the resource is only applicable in the UK (i.e. only appropriate for 
use in the UK)?  Or am I saying something else.

In which case, I presumably use Subject:

dc:subject: UK

Is this what you are saying?  Is this how everyone uses Coverage?

Hmmm.  Diane, this runs absolutely counter to my assumptions about the
semantics of coverage (per my response to Andy's earlier response).  In
fact, I am working on a project that has defined a local property for
jurisdiction (area/zone of mandated applicability) for academic
standards in teaching and learning in the US because the focus on
dc:coverage on "aboutness" made it an inappropriate place to express
such notions of jurisdiction.

Well, I think this discussion points up the possible downside of 
making explicit the topicality of Coverage, which I really don't 
think was intended. But maybe I'm the minority in this.  I certainly 
think that it has been used by may to express "aboutness" but whether 
that means we should limit it to that and force implementors to 
create local properties to express applicability is something we 
might want to discuss further.

It seems to me that, if we want to allow both uses, we might consider 
a broader definition, and suggest to somebody that they propose a 
refinement for coverage?  (I'm ducking here to avoid the rotten 
tomatoes)

I'm a bit confused now. ;-)

I think Stuart and Andy(?) are suggesting that the value space of
dc:coverage excludes "jurisdiction to which the resource is relevant"
and includes _only_ (spatial/temporal) "aboutness".

So _if_ that is the case - and I don't know whether it is the intention
behind dc:coverage or not: I've always been a bit confused about the way
people seem to use dc:coverage! - then it seems to me the definition
should _exclude_ that reference. And I'd argue that we should also say
that dc:coverage is a subproperty of dc:subject, but I'm aware I won't
get very far making that argument... ;-) 

However, I do note that AGLS seems to take the view that the value space
of dc:coverage _includes_ spatial/temporal relevance/applicability (or
however we describe it!)

See AGLS
http://www.naa.gov.au/recordkeeping/gov_online/agls/metadata_element_set
.html

where agls:jurisdiction is a refinement of dc:coverage with:

Definition: The name of the political/administrative entity covered by
the content of the resource.
Comment: Jurisdiction is a description of the territory over which a
particular government exercises its authority or a particular business
transacts its operations, to which the resource content is applicable.

If the value space of dc:coverage includes both spatial/temporal
"aboutness" _and_ spatial/temporal relevance/applicability - which I
think is Diane's position (?) and seems to be reflected in AGLS usage
(and other e-gov usage? I'm not sure) at least - then the definition
should make that clear. And in that case dc:coverage is not a
subproperty of dc:subject - though I could have a spatialTopic property
which was a subproperty of both dc:subject and dc:coverage! ;-)

That would be nice... but that wasn't really what I was suggesting.  My 
proposed (new) definition is

   The spatial or temporal scope/topic(?) of the resource or the
   jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.

i.e. I don't exclude "jurisdiction to which the resource is relevant".

I don't see how we can remove the bit about jurisdiction without breaking 
a lot of existing usage.

Basically, it seems to me, that coverage is pretty much as broken as 
format is (since they both try to define two things :-( ).  But we are 
stuck with that situation.

I'm arguing that (however much I dislike it!) coverage covers both 
'aboutness' (the spatial or temporal scope/topic(?) of the resource) and 
'applicability' (the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant).

Furthermore, I thought that Diane was arguing that coverage only covers 
the 'applicability' aspect, i.e. the applicability in spatial, temporal or 
jusidictional terms, and *not* the 'aboutness'...  but maybe I'm 
mis-interpretting what she is saying.

Well, as I say above, that *is* also my position (though I didn't think it 
was Diane's) and the proposed definition makes both aspects of the 
semantics clear (to me).

OK, well I'm happy to go with that interpretation. However, FWIW, my view 
is that "the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant" is close 
enough to 'aboutness' to fall within dc:subject. For example, I'm 
struggling to think of an example where the jurisdiction (as given in 
coverage) wouldn't also be appropriate for adding to a 'Keywords' meta 
tag.

That may apply in some cases but I'm not sure it works in all cases. If
I have 

(a) "Planning your tour of the UK (for visitors from the US)"
(b) "Planning your tour of the UK (for vistors from Brazil)"

the spatial relevance/applicability of (a) is USA (or maybe USA and UK)
and the spatial relevance/applicability of (b) is Brazil (or maybe
Brazil and UK)

But the spatial "aboutness" of both (a) and (b) is UK, not USA or
Brazil.

Ah, but I think meta/keywords is broader than dc:subject?

For my (a) above, I might well include both USA and UK as my
meta/keywords but that doesn't necessarily mean I should include them
both as values for dc:subject.

Actually now that I look for it I'm not sure where the scope of
meta/keywords is specified! The best I can find is

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#edef-META

and

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#recs

It seems to me the keywords in meta/keywords aren't limited to
aboutness: they are _any_ keywords useful for retrieval.

Whereas for dc:subject, keywords are supposed to describe the topic of
the resource i.e, they are limited to "aboutness", not any old keyword.

But yeah, I am hair-splitting here, and in practice I suspect the use of
dc:subject is rather looser too.

Well, if coverange is capable of being both aboutness and jurisdiction,
it is quite broken indeed. People looking for resources about
"California" using coverage are unlikely to be satisfied retrieving
descriptions of the various chapters of the California statutes,
administrative code, and case law.  And clearly, people looking for
jurisdictional documents would be absolutely unlikely to be satisfied in
the least with resources on the history of the California state flower
(poppy) or the Gold Rush.   Jurisdiction and aboutness are conceptually
different notions.  To be capable of expressing both jurisdiction and
aboutness is to end up expressing neither with any certainty...or so it
seems to me.

been around at the inception (such as it was), this was not 
unintentional, though indeed our current sensibility is very much 
against the kind of ambiguity represented here. The inclusion of the

representation was important--I don't think they cared so much about 
the definition of the element, just that there was someplace to put 
geographic information, for whatever purpose.

I agree with Stuart that the use cases we have discussed, and the 
implementations we know about, suggest that we might want to take 
some action here.  I agree with Pete (I think it was) that there is 
enough "aboutness" in our notion of jurisdiction that we should be 
able to do something reasonable, without breaking existing 
implementations. It may be that we should look to Format as our 
guide, where the Extent and Medium refinements make the distinctions 
we discovered "after the fact" of defining the Format element. In the 
case of Coverage, we might be able to do with one.

And yes, this was what I was trying to get at in my first post, 
though certainly, in retrospect, I didn't get there via a straight 
line. But then, neither did much in Dublin Core ...

I think that was Andy. I was agreeing with Stuart and saying that
"aboutness" and "relevance/applicability" were different notions (and by
implication agreeing that having them rolled into a single property
didn't seem very useful). What I wasn't sure about was whether the
dc:coverage property did actually encompass both these notions, but it
seems that it does. :-(

I guess it would be possible to coin something like

dcterms:relevance ("A time or place for which the resource is relevant
or applicable") 

with 

dcterms:relevance rdfs:subpropertyOf dc:coverage

(I think you could get away without dcterms:spatialRelevance and
dcterms:temporalRelevance as well, and examine the type of the value
instead, but I'm not sure.)

But that doesn't change the fact that you can't tell whether references
to the existing dc:coverage, dcterms:spatial and dcterms:temporal
properties are being used for aboutness or for relevance.

i.e. if I find

thing:x dcterms:spatial country:Spain .
thing:x dcterms:relevance country:Spain .

I still don't know whether thing:x is "about" Spain or not.

Oops, sorry! Sometimes when you guys get the bit between your teeth,

Given that we've not seen much call for relevance for temporal 
information, and "jurisdiction" seems to be our challenge, couldn't 
we consider some of the definitional work that Stuart has done for 
that as an element and use is for a refinement?  Really, doesn't 
Spatial and Temporal deal primarily with the "aboutness" portion?

That's true, but isn't that a function of the fact that "relevance" 
as a concept isn't particularly well understood in our community?  In 
contrast, I think the people who work with jurisdictions (like 
lawyers and governments) understand that concept instinctively and 
don't tend to ask questions like the one you just asked ... ;-)  As 
for the worry about already encoded information, consider when we 
added StillImage and MovingImage to DCMIType. We didn't know whether 
things that were already encoded as images were one or the other.

I was assuming that both dcterms:spatial and dcterms:temporal suffered from the
same problem as dc:coverage (i.e. they encompass both "aboutness" and
"relevance/applicability").

I'm afraid "primarily" isn't any use to an application, though ;-). Either they
do or they don't.

I hadn't really developed the concept of "relevance" in any real way - what I
was trying to get at was that since dc:coverage has both a temporal and spatial
aspect, the problem of distinguishing aboutness and relevance is present in both
of those dimensions. (Of course then there is an overlap with things like
dcterms:valid, too)

(To be honest, it's a bit of a mess: I suspect the problem isn't really fix-able
without scrapping the current dc:coverage term and redefining it more
coherently, but I recognise that would be a "major semantic impact"/new URI
needed sort of case, so I'm not really proposing that as a course of action.)

Agreed, but in that case the more general case ("it's an Image") is still
(fairly) useful; in the dc:coverage case (as Stuart pointed out yesterday), the
statement that "It's either about this time/place or it's relevant/applicable to
this time/place  - but you can not know which" is, arguably, not very useful at
all. You might almost just as well use dc:relation (some association with thsi
time/place). This has always been my problem with dc:coverage - the _potential_
scope means that any _actual_ use serves little real purpose.

I'm inclined to agree with Stuart, and in an ideal world the Right Thing
To Do would be to coin different properties to represent the different
notions. 

But given that the existing hybrid use of all _three_ of dc:coverage,
dcterms:spatial and dcterms:temporal is out there, the options for
fixing it seem pretty messy.
