Folks:

According to the meeting notes, I agreed to slightly revise those
definitions that do not specifically refer to the resource being
described.  Based on my notes, I offer the following for comment:

Suggestions for Revised Definitions (added wording in italics)


consultant

    Now: A person or organization called upon for professional
    advice or services in a specialized field of knowledge
    or training.

    Suggested revision: A person or organization relevant to
    a resource or work, who is called upon for professional
    advice or services in a specialized field of knowledge
    or training.

contractor

    Now: A person or organization who enters into a contract
    with another person or organization to perform a specific
    task.

    Suggested revision: A person or organization relevant
    to a resource or work, who enters into a contract with
    another person or organization to perform a specific task.

conductor

     Now: A person who directs a performance group (orchestra,
     chorus, opera, etc.)

     Suggested revision: A person who directs a musical group
     (orchestra, chorus, opera, etc.) in a musical or dramatic
     presentation or entertainment.

inventor

     Now: A person or organization who first produces a
     particular useful item, or develops a new process for
     obtaining a known item or result.

     Suggested revision: [None, I think this one is really
     okay, given the context of an "item."]

teacher

     Now: A person who gives instruction in an intellectual
     subject or demonstrates while teaching physical skills.

     Suggested revision: A person who, in the context of a
     resource, gives instruction in an intellectual subject
     or demonstrates while teaching physical skills.

Note that under draftsman, the usual comment, "Typically,
the name of the XXX should be used to indicate the agent" is
not present, but there is another comment.  Was the absence
of this generalized comment intentional?  I think it should
be in there ...

Also note that under performer, the definition begins with
a lower case "a" instead of upper case.
