NISO ballot on DCMES - response to comments

Shepherd: Akira

The final vote tally for the ballot on NISO/ANSI Z39.85 [1] was
YES: 47, NO: 1 (National Library of Medicine), ABSTAIN: 1.

Our task in Barcelona is to formulate responses to each of
the comments for submission to NISO by the end of March.
The last column is where you indicate whether the response
action would be an editorial (E) or substantive (S) change
to the standard text.

Comment 1: NLM in general

    The underlying reason for the No vote is that the revision
    does not resolve the fundamental issues that caused NLM to
    vote No on the original ballot for the standard. Therefore,
    we believe that the consistent position is to vote No
    on the revision. Although the most important issue in
    NLM's No vote in the 2001 standard was that none of
    the elements in Dublin Core are essential or required,
    other reasons included issues related to the definition
    for the Title element and the relationship between the
    Source and Relation elements (which are also addressed
    in our comments below regarding the current revision).

    Regarding the specific semantic revisions that are
    presented on the current ballot, the NLM review group
    found that these are minor revisions with the goal of
    clarifying intended semantics and to bring the wording
    of the definitions and usage comments into line with
    the language of the DCMI Abstract Model. In general,
    the review group felt that the changes proposed have
    succeeded in achieving this goal. We do, however, offer
    some specific comments about a few of the proposed changes.

Note: http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/DC-NLM-vote.html (from 2001-01-31):

    Element Name: Title, under "comments" we suggest deletion
    of the word "formally" - the terms may mean something to
    a catalogers but may not mean anything to others outside
    of the information professional and may lead to confusion;

    Element Name: Source and Element Name: Relation - The
    differences between these two element is difficult to
    discern even for some information specialists. Several
    foreign DCMESs were reviewed and many struggled with
    definitions that would differentiation these elements. The
    outcome varied between the various interpretations since
    translations do not clarify the ambiguities.

Comment 2: CDL about sections 1 and 3

    RFC 2396 (URI Syntax) is clearly obsoleted by RFC
    3986. References to it should be changed to RFC 3986. This
    also affects a sentence in the Purpose and Scope section:
    "A resource is defined here to be anything which has
    identity, as in the definitions used in Internet RFC 2396,
    Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, by
    Tim Berners-Lee et al., and in the DCMI Abstract Model, by
    Andy Powell et al." This sentence would be better worded
    consistent with RFC 3986 (which backs away from defining
    resource) along the lines of the recently revised RFC 2413
    (for Dublin Core), which reads: "As in Internet RFC 3986
    [RFC3986], "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic
    Syntax," this specification does not limit the scope of
    what might be a resource

http://dublincore.org/documents/2007/02/05/abstract-model/:

    resource (http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource)

        Anything that might be identified. Familiar examples
        include an electronic document, an image, a service
        (for example, "today's weather report for Los
        Angeles"), and a collection of other resources. Not
        all resources are network "retrievable"; for example,
        human beings, corporations, concepts and bound books
        in a library can also be considered resources.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt:

    Resource

        A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar
        examples include an electronic document, an image, a service
        (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a
        collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network
        "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
        books in a library can also be considered resources.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt:

    Resource

        This specification does not limit the scope of what
        might be a resource; rather, the term "resource"
        is used in a general sense for whatever might be
        identified by a URI.  Familiar examples include
        an electronic document, an image, a source of
        information with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's
        weather report for Los Angeles"), a service (e.g.,
        an HTTP-to-SMS gateway), and a collection of other
        resources.  A resource is not necessarily accessible
        via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations,
        and bound books in a library can also be resources.
        Likewise, abstract concepts can be resources, such
        as the operators and operands of a mathematical
        equation, the types of a relationship (e.g., "parent"
        or "employee"), or numeric values (e.g., zero, one,
        and infinity).

Comment 3: CDL on sections 1 and 3: RFC 3066 obsoleted by RFC 4646

    RFC 3066 (Language Tags) is clearly obsolete. References
    to RFC 3066 should all be changed to RFC 4646.

======================================================================
Comment 4: NARA, Definition and comment for dc:format

    The 'Definition' section of the term 'Coverage' includes
    the new term 'spatial applicability', which is not further
    explained (as are 'spatial topic', 'temporal topic' and
    'jurisdiction') in the 'Comments' section. The definition of
    'spatial applicability' is addressed in 'Editorial changes
    to terms in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES) -
    response to comments', so it is unusual that a clarification
    was not incorporated in this draft standard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2006/2006-03.response-to-comments.shtml

6) For the element Coverage, the following definition had
   been proposed for public comment:

        The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, or
        the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.

   The Treasury Board reviewers felt that the words "spatial
   or temporal topic of the resource" did not capture the full
   scope of usage of this element within the Government of
   Canada, where the spatial aspect of Coverage is also used
   for resources that "apply to" a certain geographic area
   (e.g., for employment opportunities in a specific area).

   The reviewers suggested the definition:

        The spatial or temporal characteristics of the
        resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource
        is relevant.

   However, the Usage Board felt that the examples given do,
   in fact, fall under the proposed definition of Coverage,
   as "applicability" falls under a broad view of "aboutness".

   That spatial applicability is in scope has been made clear
   in the definition approved by the Usage Board:

        The spatial or temporal topic of the resource,
        the spatial applicability of the resource, or the
        jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.

   The Usage Board notes that including temporal applicability
   within the scope of Coverage would have introduced an
   overlap with the element refinement Valid ("Date (often
   a range) of validity of a resource").

The definition of Type was subject to careful discussion in
light of implementation experience -- in practice, Type has
been interpreted quite broadly -- and in light of the DCMI
Abstract Model.  Comparing the existing definition, from 1999:

    The nature or genre of the content of the resource.

to the definition proposed for public comment:

    The genre, functional category, or aggregation level
    of the resource.

the Usage Board felt that the proposed definition makes the
semantics of Type more specific in ways that are not well
understood.  The definition that was approved:

    The nature or genre of the resource.

follows the wording of the existing definition and retains
its broad applicability.

3.14. Coverage

2001> Element Name:   Coverage
2001> Label:          Coverage
2001> Definition:     The extent or scope of the content of the 
2001>                 resource.
2001> Comment:        Typically, Coverage will include spatial
2001>                 location (a place name or geographic
2001>                 coordinates), temporal period (a
2001>                 period label, date, or date range),
2001>                 or jurisdiction (such as a named
2001>                 administrative entity). Recommended best
2001>                 practice is to select a value from a
2001>                 controlled vocabulary (for example, the
2001>                 Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]) and
2001>                 to use, where appropriate, named places
2001>                 or time periods in preference to numeric
2001>                 identifiers such as sets of coordinates
2001>                 or date ranges.

2006> Name:           coverage
2006> Label:          Coverage
2006> Definition:     The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the
2006>                 spatial applicability of the resource, or the 
2006>                 jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.
2006> Comment:        Spatial topic may be a named place or a location 
2006>                 specified by its geographic coordinates. Temporal
2006>                 period may be a named period, date, or date
2006>                 range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative
2006>                 entity or a geographic place to which the resource
2006>                 applies. Recommended best practice is to use a 
2006>                 controlled vocabulary such as the Thesaurus of
2006>                 Geographic Names [TGN].  Where appropriate, named 
2006>                 places or time periods can be used in preference
2006>                 to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates
2006>                 or date ranges.

      -- Element Name now called Name, since 2002 in lowercase
         [see Section 2.6]

      -- In definition, replaces the ambiguous phrase "extent
         or scope of the content of the resource" with the
         phrase "spatial or temporal topic of the resource".
         The use of "extent" in the term Coverage had caused
         confusion with respect to the term Format -- the
         comment of which refers to "dimensions" such as
         "size" and "duration" -- and to the term Extent,
         a refinement of Format defined as "The size or
         duration of the resource".

      -- In definition, added the words "or the jurisdiction
         under which the resource is relevant.  The notion of
         "jurisdiction" entered into the scope of Coverage at
         an early date as part of the comment and has informed
         a significant number of implementations.  The Usage
         Board has made this meaning explicit by referring to
         "jurisdiction" in the definition itself and by further
         clarifying the intended meaning in the comment.

      -- In definition, replaces "content of the resource"
         with "resource" [see Section 2.1]

      -- In comment, replaces the phrase "select a value from
         a controlled vocabulary" with "use a controlled
         vocabulary" [see Section 2.3]

======================================================================
Comment 5: NLM Definition and comment for dc:format

    We question the use of dimensions in format, as dimensions
    are not a format but rather an attribute of format. Also,
    we question the removal of the sentence Format may be used
    to identify the software, hardware, or other equipment
    needed to display or operate the resource. Deleting this
    sentence could cause confusion among users of the standard
    who wish to record this type of information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.9.  Format    

2001> Element Name:   Format
2001> Label:          Format
2001> Definition:     The physical or digital manifestation of 
2001>                 the resource.
2001> Comment:        Typically, Format will include the
2001>                 media-type or dimensions of the resource.
2001>                 Format may be used to identify the
2001>                 software, hardware, or other equipment
2001>                 needed to display or operate the
2001>                 resource. Examples of dimensions include
2001>                 size and duration.  Recommended best
2001>                 practice is to select a value from a
2001>                 controlled vocabulary (for example,
2001>                 the list of Internet Media Types [MIME]
2001>                 defining computer media formats).

2006> Name:           format
2006> Label:          Format
2006> Definition:     The file format, physical medium, or dimensions
2006>                 of the resource.
2006> Comment:        Examples of dimensions include
2006>                 size and duration. Recommended best practice is
2006>                 to use a controlled vocabulary such as the list
2006>                 of Internet Media Types [MIME].

      -- Element Name now called Name, since 2002 in lowercase
         [see Section 2.6]

      -- The definition of Format as "The physical or digital
         manifestation of the resource" has been a
         source of confusion.  Specifically, it has been
         misinterpreted as referring to a related resource
         that is a "manifestation" in the sense of Functional
         Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR).
         The new wording moves words from the original comment
         into the definition in order to describe the intended
         meaning more concretely.

      -- In comment, drops the sentence: "Format may be used
         to identify the software, hardware, or other equipment
         needed to display or operate the resource."

      -- In comment, replaces "select a value from an encoding
         scheme" with "use a controlled vocabulary" [see Section 2.3]

===========================================================
Comment 6: CDL, definition of dc:source:

    A minor issue has to do with the initial word "The" in the
    definition of the Source element. The closest parallel
    definition is Relation (Source being a special kind of
    Relation), which begins with the non-parallel word "A",
    suggesting that there is only one Source. The confusion is
    minor because the element set does not restrict the number
    of occurrences of the Source element.

In the penultimate version of DCMES of 2006-08-28, Source
was defined as "A related resource..." [1].  In the set of
changes proposed for Public Comment on 2006-08-28, Source
was also defined as "A related resource..." [2].

After Public Comment was held, decisions were taken at the
meeting in Manzanillo, at which time the article "The" in
"The resource" was introduced in the context removing the
redundant word "related" as per comments from the Canadian
Treasury Board [3, quoted below].  

The switch from "A" to "The" carried over into decision text
of 2006-12-18 and the error went undetected by reviewers of
the decision text in the Usage Board [4].  The change was
also noted in the "Response to comments" of 2006-12-18 [5].
The decision text was then used to published "DCMI Metadata
Terms" on 2006-12-18 [6], published by NISO for ballot on
2007-01-23 and as Internet-Draft draft-kunze-rfc2413bis-06.txt
on 2007-02-19 by IETF [7].

-- Discussion of Treasury Board of Canada comments on the
   proposed changes to DCMES

   AGREED: For dc:source, the word 'related' in the definition
   is redundant and should be removed. The new definition
   for Source will be the wording proposed in the Canadian
   Treasury Board comments: "The resource from which the
   described resource is derived.".

   ACTION 2006-09-30: Tom - Change dc:source definition to read:
   "The resource from which the described resource is derived"
   [see http://dublincore.org/usage/public-comment/2006/08/dcmes-changes/].

======================================================================
Comment 7: NLM Definition of dc:source

    We find the definition and comment still extremely
    confusing and question the use of related resource to
    describe the source. We understand that source is a
    special type of related resource but this is not made
    clear in the revisions. We recommend restating the
    definition to The resource from which the described
    resource is derived in whole or in part. The comment
    would then read, The described resource may be derived
    from the related resource. Recommended best practice is
    to identify the source by means of a string conforming
    to a formal identification system.

3.11. Source

2001> Element Name:   Source
2001> Label:          Source
2001> Definition:     A reference to a resource from which 
2001>                 the present resource is derived.
2001> Comment:        The present resource may be derived
2001>                 from the Source resource in whole or
2001>                 in part. Recommended best practice is
2001>                 to identify the referenced resource by

2001>                 to a formal identification system.

2006>                 related resource in whole or in part. Recommended
2006>                 best practice is to identify the related resource
2006>                 by means of a string conforming to a formal

      -- Element Name now called Name, since 2002 in lowercase
         [see Section 2.6]

      -- In the definition, changes "present resource" to
         "described resource", both more precise and consistent
         with the DCMI Abstract Model

      -- In definition, replaces "a reference to a resource"
         with "resource" [see Section 2.2]

      -- In comment, drops the redundant words "or number"

======================================================================
Comment 8: NLM, Comment for dc:subject

    We question why the comment contains the phrase the topic will
    be represented. rather than the subject will be represented.
    as is the case in many of the other elements in which the
    element name is repeated in the comment field. Repeating
    the element name in the comment field would help provide
    consistency among the elements.

      -- Change of label from "Subject and Keywords" to
         "Subject".  It continues to be acknowledged in the
         comment that a subject may be expressed with keywords.
         This change also brings the label of the element 
         ("Subject") in line with its name ("subject").

      -- In definition, replaces "content of the resource"
         with "resource" [see Section 2.1]

Hi John,

I'm writing to comment on draft-kunze-rfc2413bis-05.txt
(http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-kunze-rfc2413bis/).

On behalf of the News Industry, I wish to repeat our strong opposition
to the comment against the DC title element:

    Typically, Title will be a name by which the resource is formally
    known.

    This is true of no Web page that I know of (including the DC Web pages)
    and is certainly not true of News stories.

    If the DC community continues to insist that the Earth is flat, other
    communities are forced to form their own views of DC's powers of
    observation and interest in listening.

    Regards,
    Misha -- Co-author of RFC 2413 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2413.txt)

I'll start by mentioning that I've put on a hard hat and a flame-
retardant cape, just in case I need them.

It's also worth reiterating Stu's mention of my long involvement
with DC.  See, for example, RFC 2413 (Dublin Core Metadata for
Resource Discovery), dating from 1998:
   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2413.txt

As I've mentioned in previous postings, the News Architecture
Working Party of the International Press Telecommunications Council
(IPTC) is actively examining the use of DC for those of our metadata
elements where there is a good semantic fit.  Having been involved
with DC all those years ago, I had assumed that this would be a
relatively pain-free matter.  I was wrong.  Consider the humble
title.  RFC 2413 defines this as:

   The name given to the resource, usually by the Creator or
   Publisher.

The current official DC documentation states:

   Definition: A name given to the resource.

   Comment   : Typically, Title will be a name by which the resource
               is formally known.

Ouch!  This comment may well work for the Library community.  It
certainly does not work for many other communities, such as Web page
authors, professional photographers, or news organisations.

If I change the title of one of the hundreds of Web pages I maintain,
I am most certainly not changing "a name by which the resource is
formally known".

The same applies to a professional photographer changing the title
of one of thousands of photos on her/his computer.

And the same applies to a news story ... the title (ie headline) is
most certainly not any kind of formal name.

So we have a problem.  If the Semantic Web is to work, it is not
enough to employ some common syntax or even a common abstract model. 
We need to be able to share meaning.  And this is obviously a
balancing act between having definitions that are so broad that they
become meaningless and definitions that are so narrow that they fit
only one community and are not shareable.  Those of us working on
the architecture of mainstream news standards, perceive the comment
associated with dc:title as being on the latter end of the spectrum.

And so, as Chair of the IPTC News Metadata Framework WG, I am asking
the DC community to reconsider the text of the comment accompanying
the definition of dc:title.

Many thanks,
Misha Wolf

This seems easy to me...

Point A:

The DEFINITION is broad and inclusive, and seems to me to clearly
satisfy both the biblioheads and the webheads.

The COMMENT is just that... A comment.  Intended to clarify (oops... We
might not have done the best possible thing in this case, though the
word 'typically' is a very legitimate trap door).

Definitions are normative, comments are... well... Comments.

Point B:

The tricky balance that Misha articulates below has always been hard,
and inevitably rough around the margins:

    a balancing act between having definitions that are so broad
    that they become meaningless and definitions that are so narrow
    that they fit only one community and are not shareable.

Always we should be apply the test of common sense... In this case, its
asking the question...

What is the most title-like-object in this resource, and if I choose it,
am I likely to blow up any other  community's notion of THEIR
title-like-object?

The answer seems SOOOO obvious to me that I can't understand why this is
even an issue.

Hey, Misha... We've missed you!

Comment 10, NLM Comment for dc:type

    We question the deletion of the sentence Type includes
    terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or
    aggregation levels for content. We feel that by removing
    this sentence it has taken away the guidance that was
    previously present and resulted in a less user-friendly
    comment. If one of the objectives of this revision is to
    define elements at a high-level without much implementation
    guidance, by only providing a definition and recommended
    best practices, then the standard should be consistent
    among all of the elements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.8.  Type

2001> Element Name:   Type
2001> Label:          Resource Type
2001> Definition:     The nature or genre of the content of 
2001>                 the resource.
2001> Comment:        Type includes terms describing general
2001>                 categories, functions, genres, or
2001>                 aggregation levels for content. Recommended
2001>                 best practice is to select a value from
2001>                 a controlled vocabulary (for example, the
2001>                 DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCT]). To describe
2001>                 the physical or digital manifestation of
2001>                 the resource, use the Format element.

2006> Name:           type
2006> Label:          Type
2006> Definition:     The nature or genre of the resource.
2006> Comment:        Recommended best practice is to use a controlled
2006>                 vocabulary such as the DCMI Type Vocabulary
2006>                 [DCMITYPE]. To describe the file format, physical
2006>                 medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the
2006>                 Format element.

      -- Element Name now called Name, since 2002 in lowercase
         [see Section 2.6]

      -- In label, changed "Resource Type" to "Type" [see
         Section 2.4]

      -- In definition, replaces "content of the resource"
         with "resource" [see Section 2.1]

      -- In comment, replaces the phrase "select a value from
         a controlled vocabulary" with "use a controlled
         vocabulary" [see Section 2.3]

      -- In comment, deletes sentence: "Type includes terms
         describing general categories, functions, genres,
         or aggregation levels for content."
