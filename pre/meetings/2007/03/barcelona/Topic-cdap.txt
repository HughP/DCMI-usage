Preparation for the Barcelona meeting

The Usage Board review of CDAP in 2006 [1] identified a need for:

 * Clarity of the data model described and deployed in the AP
   (manifest in property rubrics)

 * Clarity of definitions of concepts described and deployed
   in the AP (manifest in property rubrics)

 * Consistency in the use of terminology deriving from DCMI,
   deriving from any model cited in the profile, or created
   for use in the profile

 * Clarity and usefulness of references

Questions to consider when reviewing the CD DC AP

1. Is the data model clearer?  Is the data model complete
   and consistent with stated purpose of the profile?

2. Is the distinction between Collection and Catalogue or
   Index consistent throughout?

3. Does it matter that Catalogue or Index appears at two
   different levels of remove from collection, without a change
   in terminology, as depicted on page 11?

2007-03-10: Email from Sarah Shreeves

The most substantial changes are:

1) The profile itself has been renamed "Dublin Core Collections
   Application Profile". This better reflects the resource that
   the AP is meant to describe (collections).

2) We have attempted to clarify the data model by making
   clear that, while derived from the AMCC model, it does stand
   on its own.

3) We have attempted to clarify "collection-description"
   by recategorizing "collection-description" as "catalogue or
   index", and making the necessary changes to the vocabulary
   terms and classes.

In addition we have made minor modifications to update the
profile (for example, aligning the definitions and labels
for dcterms with the most current document).

Below are the comments from the Usage Board on the CDAP from
the 2006 meeting. We have tried to respond to each.

 > 1. The data model used for the CDAP needs a better explanation. This
 >    explanation should include a statement about how the model in the
 >    Application Profile diverges from or otherwise amends the AMCC model
 >    cited as the basis for the profile. The Board feels that more
 >    explanatory material is needed to assist in relating the data model to
 >    the AP where dependencies exist.

After discussions with the task force, we clarified that
the data model does stand on its own and, although it is
derived from the Analytical Model of Collections and their
Catalogues, there are not dependencies. External references
to the Analytical Model of Collections and their Catalogues
have been removed and a simple reference to the model has
been left. The relationships between entities have been
described. The correspondences between the relationships
represented in the data model and the DC Collections AP
properties have been listed. See the introduction to the
Application Profile.

 >2. The document should include a summary statement of the
 >   purpose and scope of the CDAP.

A new section "Purpose and Scope" has been added to the
Application Profile. It describes the objectives and scope of
the profile. It clearly defines that the profile can be used
to describe either collections as aggregations of physical
or digital resources or catalogs or indices as collections
as aggregations of metadata that describe a collection.

 > 3. The Board feels that the distinction between "use of CDAP for
 >    collection descriptions" and "use of CDAP for collections of collection
 >    descriptions" is a bit confusing, and the CDAP should more clearly
 >    separate the two.  This might be achieved by splitting the current CDAP
 >    into two separate APs -- one for collection descriptions and one for
 >    collections of collection descriptions. Editorial decisions of this
 >    nature are at the discretion of the working group.

After discussions among members of the task force, it did not
appear necessary to create two distinct profiles. However,
the terminology has been clarified to avoid possible
confusions. Whenever possible specific statements have been
made for the use of the DC Collections AP for collections
or for the use of DC Collections AP for collections
descriptions. The collection descriptions have been renamed
to avoid confusions. See the comment below as well.

 > 4. The Board suggests the Working Group reconsider the change of label
 >    for the term 'Collection-Description' [2]. The Board feels that the old
 >    label, 'Catalogue or collection description' [3] is clearer and easier
 >    to understand because the label itself is an example of a typical use
 >    for the term.

The term "collection-description" has been replaced by
"Catalogues or Indices". This term encompasses a range of
non-unitary finding aids including, catalogues, finding aids,
and indexes. This label covers more adequately the intended
scope of the application profile. In addition, we deleted the
class http://purl.org/cld/cdtype/UnitaryFindingAid because,
as Pete Johnston points out, the DC Collections Application
Profile does not support the description of UnitaryFindingAids,
it supports the creation of UnitaryFindingAids. We also
asserted that the three classes, HierarchicFindingAid,
IndexingFindingAid, and AnalyticFindingAid, are subclasess
of http://purl.org/cld/cdtype/CatalogueOrIndex. We think that
this has helped to clarify the terminology and model.

 > 5. The term 'Content' is not defined in the AP, but is used in a
 >    definition for 'item' [4]. The Board asks the Working Group to include
 >    a definition of `content` in the AP Glossary.

The reference to "Content" has been removed. The definition
for item is: A physical or digital resource.

 > In general, the Board prefers that Application Profiles be able to
 > 'stand alone' as documents; ideally, readers of the CDAP should not
 > need to refer to external documents in order to understand its logic
 > and suggests that the working group consider adding some additional
 > contextual information from external documents as an aid to the reader.

We have tried to extract the reliance on the AMCC document
for the data model and include necessary definitions. It
would be useful to know if there are other references that
need clarification.
