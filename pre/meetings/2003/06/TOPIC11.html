TOPIC 11. AskDCMI (Stuart and Diane)

   Stuart and Diane will report on AskDCMI, which has been
   in operation for the past few weeks.  We will discuss the 
   role of Usage Board members in handling questions.

   Diane Hillmann, Andy Powell, Roland Schwaenzl, Stuart
   Sutton, Stuart Weibel, Andrew Wilson, and Mary Woodley.

   for claiming and answering questions, to see if we can
   smooth out our handling of questions.

   -- I'd like to get a feel from the group about where this
   needs augmenting, changing, etc.
