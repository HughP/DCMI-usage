Schedule:  http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/Schedule.html

TOPIC 01. Mission and principles (Tom)

   Some issues related to dumb-down need clarification --
   for example, does dumb-down mean "resolve all sub-property
   relationships" or "resolve to Elements (as opposed to
   Element Refinements)"?  Other issues relate to Encoding
   Schemes (how valid is the distinction between Vocabulary
   and Syntax encoding schemes?). We cannot resolve these
   issues without first discussing a draft on the list, so
   in Ithaca we should aim merely to identify and prioritize
   the open issues.

   The Mission document has been updated to remove redundant
   text about grammatical principles (which has since been
   moved to the the DCMI Grammatical Principles).

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC01.html
   -- DCMI Grammatical Principles

   -- Email digest on "vocabulary" vs "syntax" encoding schemes
      http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC01.types-of-encoding-schemes.html

   Time needed: 30"

TOPIC 02. Usage Board Process (Stuart)

   A brief report on changes or clarifications made since
   the Florence meeting.

   Copies of the Process documents have been put into the
   "background readings" packet.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC02.html

   Time needed: 20"

TOPIC 03. DCMI Documentation (Tom)

   Brief report on the work-flow for generating Web pages
   and RDF schemas from the raw term declaration data in XML.

   There are small differences of wording between the DCMI
   Terms document and the newly published ISO standard.
   In Ithaca, we will vote on changing the DCMI wordings to
   bring them into line with the ISO standard.  Once this
   is done, we will need to inform John Kunze so that he can
   revise the RFC.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC03.html
   -- Differences between Usage Board documentation and ISO/NISO
      http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/UB-ISO.differences.html

   Time needed: 30"

TOPIC 04. "Using Dublin Core" (Diane)

    Diane has revised "Using Dublin Core" (e.g., with specific
    guidance for individual element refinements).  Since DCMI
    has no real process for approving the revision of this
    document (or at least none that really works), we should
    figure out how to bring the process of revision to a close.
    Time permitting, we could perhaps return to this document
    after other business is taken care of in order to discuss
    issues of content.

    The entire draft of "Using Dublin Core" is available in
    the packet of "background readings".

    Time needed: 30"

    Required reading:
    -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC04.html

TOPIC 05. Attributes of DCMI Terms (Tom)

   Put another way: What is the Application Profile used by
   the Usage Board to declare terms?  Do we need to clarify the
   details of this profile and declare it formally?

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC05.html
   -- Usage Board Application Profile (draft)

   Time needed: 30"

TOPIC 06. RDF schemas of DCMI terms (Roland/Makx/Tom)

   Tom, Roland, Eric, Dave Beckett, Makx, and Stu held a
   round of discussions earlier this year with the goal of
   resolving modeling issues for declaring DCMI terms in
   RDF schemas.  Makx, Tom, and Roland will report on the
   status of these discussions and on future paths forward.
   We will discuss the role of the Usage Board as compared
   with DC-Architecture and other groups within DCMI with
   regard to the schemas.

   Time needed: 45"

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC06.html

TOPIC 07. Registration of Encoding Schemes (Traugott)

   In Ithaca, we should evaluate the test period for Encoding
   Scheme registration and and clarify any problems that may
   have arisen.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC07.html
   -- Guidelines for Vocabulary and Encoding Scheme Qualifiers,

   -- Proposals pending as of 2003-06-11
      http://wip.dublincore.org/schemes/searchServlet?reqType=summary&status=pen.

   Time needed: 90"

TOPIC 08. Structured Values, or "DCSVs" (Andy)

   Andy has developed a "Usage Board view of Structured Values"
   that we can discuss among ourselves in Ithaca and then
   with DC-AB and DC-Architecture.  Once UB principles are
   agreed we can go back to Citation WG and Libraries WG with
   advice about submitting proposals for structured values.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC08.html
   -- Andy's discussion paper (2003-06-10)
      http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/Structured-values.html

   Time needed: 90"

TOPIC 09. Libraries profile (Rebecca)

   A brief report should identify any further actions that
   may need to be undertaken by Usage Board in support of
   the Library Application Profile.  We should try to approve
   the nine proposed encoding schemes on a fast-track basis.
   With reference to the Usage Board review guidelines, we
   should discuss the feasibility of undertaking a formal
   review of the profile at the Seattle meeting.

   The entire Libraries Application Profile is included in
   the "background readings" packet.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC09.html
   -- Proposals for encoding schemes in DC-Lib Application Profile

   Time needed: 30"

TOPIC 10. MARC Relator Terms as Refinements for Contributor (Rebecca)

   In Florence, we agreed to work with the Library of Congress
   to have MARC relator terms declared as refinements of
   Contributor.  LC is currently implementing this decision
   and Rebecca can report in Ithaca.  We should determine
   whether the Usage Board needs to follow through, and how,
   and identify any lessons learned.  After Ithaca, we will
   need to prepare a document explaining how MARC Relator
   terms can be used as refinements for Contributor.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC10.html
   -- Assignment of URIs to metadata terms of MARC 21 - Action plan

   Time needed: 90"

TOPIC 11. AskDCMI (Stuart and Diane)

   Stuart and Diane will report on AskDCMI, which has been
   in operation for the past few weeks.  We will discuss the 
   role of Usage Board members in handling questions.

   Required viewing:

   Time needed: 30"

TOPIC 12. Proposal from DCMI Type Working Group (Diane)

   Two related proposals have been submitted to add terms
   to the DCMI Type Vocabulary -- "Moving Image" and "Still
   Image".  We need to vote on these.

   Required reading:
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC12.html
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/StillImage.html
   -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/MovingImage.html

   Time needed: 90"

TOPIC 13. Strategic role of Usage Board (Makx)

   As Managing Director of DCMI, Makx will lead a discussion
   of the strategic role of the Usage Board for DCMI in
   the medium term.  Some of this discussion can take place
   during breaks and at meals, but we should probably consider
   drafting a planning document over the next few months.

   Questions to consider include:
   - How does the UB relate to strategic planning of DCMI as an
     organisation?
   - Should the UB contribute more clearly to strategic objectives
     by soliciting proposals in certain areas?
   - Where will proposals come from in the future?

   Time needed: 45"

TOPIC 14. Seattle meeting and timing (Tom)

    DC2003 is scheduled for Sunday 28 September through
    Thursday 2 October 2003.  In scheduling a Usage Board
    meeting we need to consider that Rosh-Hashanah is on
    September 27-28 and Yom Kippur on Monday, 7 October.
    These constraints seem to point towards holding a UB
    meeting after the conference, so we will need to discuss
    the exact timing.

    Required reading:
    -- http://stage.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2003/06/TOPIC14.html

    Time needed: 15"

TOPIC 15. Dublin Core Application Profiles (Tom)

    Tom, Makx, Rachel, and Thomas Fischer have drafted
    Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles.  Based on
    an analysis of over twenty existing application profiles
    of Dublin Core, the draft guidelines aim at providing
    a sensible and coherent format that will meet the needs
    of most Application Profile creators; that is as simple
    as possible yet as detailed as is sometimes necessary;
    and that will lend itself in the future to transformation
    into machine-processable forms.  Should the Usage Board
    approve of, promote, or use these guidelines?  Would the 
    Usage Board need to discuss these guidelines in detail?

    Required reading:

TOPIC 16. Other issues (Tom)

    Here is a file where I have simply "dumped" issues which
    (at the time of dumping) seemed like they may some day need
    to be addressed.  Please browse this file at your leisure
    and point out if any issues have already been addressed
    or should move up in our list of priorities.
