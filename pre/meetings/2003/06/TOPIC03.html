TOPIC 03. DCMI Documentation (Tom)

   Brief report on the work-flow for generating Web pages
   and RDF schemas from the raw term declaration data in XML.

   There are small differences of wording between the DCMI
   Terms document and the newly published ISO standard.
   In Ithaca, we will vote on changing the DCMI wordings to
   bring them into line with the ISO standard.  Once this
   is done, we will need to inform John Kunze so that he can
   revise the RFC.

   A copy of the ISO document has been put into the
   "background" packet.
