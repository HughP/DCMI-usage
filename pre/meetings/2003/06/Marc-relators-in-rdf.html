2003-02-07: Roland on MARC Relators
------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Let me try to summarize: the RDF block below currently
&gt; says that <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/cns">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/cns</a> (or
&gt; <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/censor">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/censor</a>, if LOC decides to
&gt; use full words instead of three-letter codes) is a subproperty
&gt; of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor</a> (careful *not*
&gt; to use <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor!">http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor!</a>).  It also says
&gt; that <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/cns">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/cns</a> is labelled "Censor",
&gt; "Bowdlerizer", and "Expurgator".

I like the /relators/cns - 
(In fact that's the way we already use marc relators)

It's a pretty good idea to use the "code" to create a URI.
That's a systematic device all classification systems basically
could and should use.  All what they then have to do is to
provide a namespace URI and the concatenation rule.

&gt; One question is how the RDF can indicate that of the three
&gt; labels, "Censor" is preferred.

If one thinks the preference given to "censor" is not
essential, then one should go with an iterated label. If one
thinks it suffices the preference understandable for humans,
one could put a remark in the comment.

An alternative would be to use dc:title and dct:alternative
instead of rdfs:label. 

dc:title is nothing but a range extension to rdfs:label in that
"literal value" is not required for dc:title.  dc:title could
also have an rdf:Alt container as value, which (in RDF M&S)
gives the first item the role of a default - Various versions
with fine grained differences in meaning are possible.

&gt; The other question is whether, alternatively, two additional
&gt; URIs should be created for "Bowdlerizer" and "Expurgator"
&gt; -- URIs which would then be related to the URI for "Censor"
&gt; using the relation daml:samePropertyAs.  And if so, how would
&gt; "Censor" then be marked as the preferred term.

More work and you end up with the same issue to select
a default in a class of objects explicitly declared as
equivalent.

An additional drawback is with instance data: Whatever you do
to deprecate the use of the unwanted URIs - they stay valid.
So you create in effect the problem you want to get rid of.

It would make sense to constitute resources to make the titles
referentiable, in case one wants to provide translations of the
English words separately - instead of other language titles
for the concept (!) represented by the code.  The URI's for
these resources then would be totally unrelated to the URIs
for the marc relators. They could perhaps be taken from a
URIified English dictionary.

One should think of a URI associated with a descriptor simply
as a way of assigning a "code" primarily for consumption of
web applications - there is no particular voodoo built in.

Be aware of daml stuff - will sooner or later become superseded
by owl.

Anyway...fine grained sophisticated label structures one
could create at some time in the future, when one really is
sure about what purpose these structures should serve.

For the start: take the easiest approach, which does not
assert something really wrong.  Be sure: Highly sophisticated
structures are currently not much appreciated by most of
the users.
