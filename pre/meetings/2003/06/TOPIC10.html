TOPIC 10. MARC Relator Terms as Refinements for Contributor (Rebecca)

   In Florence, we agreed to work with the Library of Congress
   to have MARC relator terms declared as refinements of
   Contributor.  LC is currently implementing this decision
   and Rebecca can report in Ithaca.  We should determine
   whether the Usage Board needs to follow through, and how,
   and identify any lessons learned.  After Ithaca, we will
   need to prepare a document explaining how MARC Relator
   terms can be used as refinements for Contributor.

With regard to markup in RDF of our entire relator code list:
there is still the question about how we are coding the
equivalent terms that needs to be discussed.  The first term
that illustrates the problem of equivalent terms is artist
(uri: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators.art">http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators.art</a>), where we have
used 2 labels for the same thing ("Artist" and "Graphic
technician"). But that doesn't really work because we want
to say that graphic technician is another name for artist,
but artist should be used instead.

The URIs are named as we proposed in the CORES article, so
this text should perhaps be included in the packet because it
has some impact on some of the documents we'll be discussing
in the UB meetings. One is this one of course. There is the
general issue about duplicate URIs being assigned for the
same thing, one in dcterms and one that we will be assigning
(when we do that). Example is LCSH, which has a URI in dcterms
but once we assign URIs to our elements we'll have one. I
will be mentioning this issue in the document I'm working on
concerning encoding schemes for DC-Lib AP.

We need to discuss again the issue of making creator a
refinement of contributor. We discussed at the previous
meeting but then at the conference/workshop I heard a
lot of disagreement with this approach. So we may need to
revisit. I'll be sending our marked up RDF document shortly. We
still need to settle on the best way to represent equivalent
terms when one is preferred. There were numerous discussions
about this, but this was never fully resolved, so our RDF
experts need to consider. 

In addition, I would like some guidance on how to represent
the use of the whole relator list in the library application
profile.
