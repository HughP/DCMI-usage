TOPIC 07. Registration of Encoding Schemes (Traugott)

   In Ithaca, we should evaluate the test period for Encoding
   Scheme registration and and clarify any problems that may
   have arisen.

&gt; Of course, there will be encoding schemes where the name of the scheme
&gt; lives in someone else's namespace as well.

I'd like to pick up on this final point by Andy (see full
context below).  There are two important issues here:

-- Some vocabulary providers may have a namespace URI for the
   terms in their vocabulary.  Proposers should be able to
   submit this, or add it to the DCMI term declaration at a
   later date.  The assumption here, which we would perhaps
   need to make clear, is that this URI would be different from
   the URL of a Web page merely documenting the vocabulary;
   in other words, there should perhaps be some requirement
   or expectation that there be a "namespace policy" behind
   such a URI.

-- Some vocabulary providers may also have a namespace URI
   for the name of their entire vocabulary.  If they do, then
   as Roland suggests, we should perhaps use that one instead
   of creating a new one (redundantly) in a DCMI-maintained
   namespace.  If we decide to do this, then we are in effect
   inviting people not only to submit proposals to identify
   a vocabulary with a DCMI-maintained URI, but also to
   "register" their own vocabulary-identifying URIs with us.
   If this is the case, then we need to give some thought
   about what this implies.  Does it mean that the URI gets a
   database record in the Vocabulary Management system for the
   encoding schemes, and hence outputted to the DCMI registry?
   Or would DCMI publish RDF schemas referencing those URIs?

   Could that vocabulary provider come back to us at a later
   date and add this URI?  And if so, could there be cases
   were we might want to indicate that the other URI should
   be used in preference to the DCMI-maintained URI?

As evidence that we should think this through beforehand:
someone from the Treasury Board Secretariat Canada
Interdepartmental Metadata Working Group (the body directing
and coordinating metadata efforts in the government of
Canada) contacted us in April to express the hope that scheme
registration would be de-centralized; that the Canadian
body would be able to register schemes in their domain and
count on DCMI to register schemes with broader coverage (e.g.
LCSH, DDC, etc). They were hoping that DCMI would refuse to
register schemes in their domain and refer such attempts to
their registry.

The meeting notes say:

&gt;    --      Where there is an existing 'authoritative' registry
&gt;            for a vocabulary encoding scheme we should only ask
&gt;            for the DCMI vocabulary encoding scheme name and
&gt;            the URI for the entry in the external registry.
&gt;            Traugott to update guidelines to reflect this.
&gt;            Also add field for known other tokens for this scheme.

I do not find this point reflected in
<a href="http://www.lub.lu.se/~traugott/drafts/vocab-guide4.html">http://www.lub.lu.se/~traugott/drafts/vocab-guide4.html</a>...?
I'm not entirely sure what the sentences above actually, say
but the part about adding a field for known other tokens for
this scheme would seem to indicate that we did in fact already
decide to provide a place for people to register their own URI
identifying their own vocabulary (as a whole).

If that is the case, we should perhaps discuss in the
guidelines whether they could simply "register" that URI,
or whether the DCMI Web form is only for proposing URIs to
be maintained by DCMI.

&gt;    terms in their vocabulary.  Proposers should be able to
&gt;    submit this, or add it to the DCMI term declaration at a

Why not something like:

&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:about="<a href="http://foo.org/#fooscheme">http://foo.org/#fooscheme</a>"&gt;
&lt;rdfs:comment&gt;fooscheme, the wellknown product from foo.org&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
&lt;rdfs:label&gt;fooscheme&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
&lt;dcsomething:status&gt;DCMI registered scheme&lt;/dcsomething:status&gt;
&lt;dcsomething:registrant&gt;foo.org&lt;/dcsomething:registrant&gt;
&lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="<a href="http://foo.org/">http://foo.org/</a>"/&gt;
&lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="<a href="http://foo.org/fooschemeLicence">http://foo.org/fooschemeLicence</a>"/&gt;

&gt;    Or would DCMI publish RDF schemas referencing those URIs?

see above: It also may happen that the vocab provider defines
the items IN the vocabulary via URIrefs.
Think DCMI should just take the stuff "as is" -

&gt;
&gt;    Could that vocabulary provider come back to us at a later
&gt;    date and add this URI?

Probably yes. The provider might claim the URI is branding his
product.


&gt;    And if so, could there be cases
&gt;    were we might want to indicate that the other URI should
&gt;    be used in preference to the DCMI-maintained URI?

Yes that could happen - It may depend on the Terms&Conditions
statement of the registration process.
Don't know about the legal status DCMI registration has.

&gt; I must admit to a bit of confusion, myself.  Are we testing the software

Dear all,

Confusingly, the process is actually governed by two separate
documents -- Traugott's "Guidelines" document and Section 5 of
"DCMI Usage Board Process" (see appended excerpts at the end
of this message).

The idea is that everyone should get _some_ experience with the
tool -- if only by proposing and rejecting a "fake scheme"
(as I did, or rather tried).  We need to debug both the
process and the software, and the best way to start is by
plunging in.  So far, Andy, Rebecca, and Traugott have tried
the registration tool; I tried, but like at least one other
user I never received the email confirmation so could not
follow up (Traugott can check the log files).  I am collecting
feedback from users in an Issues list.

Partly for my own clarification here is a step-by-step
overview:

1. SUBMIT a scheme [5-10 minutes]:

   a) <a href="http://wip.dublincore.org/schemes/index.html">http://wip.dublincore.org/schemes/index.html</a>
   b) Click on "Search" to make sure your scheme is
      not yet submitted or registered.
   c) Fill in the blanks and submit.

2. CONFIRM your submission [2 minutes]:

   Within 24 hours, confirm your submission according to
   email you will receive.

3. REVIEW, EDIT, AND ACCEPT OR REJECT the submission
   [10 minutes for a fake schema; longer for a real one...]

   a) <a href="http://wip.dublincore.org/schemes/index.html">http://wip.dublincore.org/schemes/index.html</a>
   b) Click on "Admin"
   c) Log in UserId: "all", Password: "test2"
   d) Click on "View pending schemes" (yours will appear
      here after you answer the confirmation email)
   e) Click on "Edit"
   f) Declare in the "Editor comment" box that you
      are working on the scheme.
   g) Follow directions to edit and accept or reject
      in accordance with the criteria (see point 4).
   h) Send feedback to Tom.

4. CRITERIA FOR DECIDING ON AND FINALIZING a scheme:

   In general: A Usage Board member reviewing a proposed
   vocabulary encoding scheme qualifier for acceptance or
   rejection should, if necessary, initiate contact with the
   maintenance agency in the case of questions or concerns about
   the status of a scheme or proposed token [process 5.6].

   a) Is the vocabulary appropriate for dc:subject?  If not,
      then reject.

   b) Is the vocabulary created and maintained by recognized
      entities and properly published [vocabulary-guidelines 3.1;
      process 5.5.3]?  If not, then reject.

   c) Verify the submitted information (e.g., name, availability,
      maintenance status) by looking at the vocabulary
      and/or contacting the maintainers [process 5.5.1-5.5.2].
      Complete the information if necessary.

   d) Establish the appropriateness of the (human-readable)
      label [vocabulary-guidelines 3.2].

   e) Verify the uniqueness and appropriateness of the proposed
      "name" -- the acronym used as a machine token [process
      5.5.4; vocabulary-guidelines 3.3].

   f) Decide on the necessity of registering multiple, specific
      versions of schemes separately [vocabulary-guidelines 3.4].

   g) Ask yourself whether the scheme might be used with elements
      not specified in the proposal [?? - process 5.5.5].

I personally have alot of questions about the burden of
responsibility for verifying specific points of detail
and on how any verifications or related correspondence with
maintainers can be accessibly archived.  It is very important
that we all get some hands-on experience with this before
the Ithaca meeting so that we can make sensible corrections
before opening up to proposals from the general public.

In the meantime, a backlog of "real" submissions is building up
which will need to be reviewed by UB members.  I am reluctant
to add to our workloads in this very busy pre-meeting time,
but we should not leave "real" submissions hanging for very
long if we can avoid it.  According to the process I am
supposed to start assigning reviewers, though I have some
issues about how I can myself manage this process efficiently
with the given tools and interfaces.  If we do not reduce
the backlog very soon, I am strongly inclined to close the
registration interface to anything but fake schemas until we
are able to fully evaluate the experience and make necessary
corrections in Ithaca.

"Guidelines for registration of Vocabulary and Encoding
Scheme Qualifiers", <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/vocabulary-guidelines/">http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/vocabulary-guidelines/</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

|    3. Guidelines
|
|    o 3.1 *Kind of schemes to be registered*
|          + 3.1.1 Only schemes which are created and maintained by
|            recognized entities and properly published may be
|            registered.
|
|    o 3.2 *Labeling of the schemes*
|
|          + 3.2.1 The scheme label should be the official title
|            the vocabulary is known under. The name of the
|            organization maintaining or owning the scheme is
|            rarely sufficient since it does not unambiguously
|            stand for the vocabulary alone.
|
|          + 3.2.2 The scheme labels and acronyms are only
|            appropriate for an unchanged use of an official
|            version of the scheme. Unofficial versions, modified
|            versions, unofficial translations and similar should
|            not use the official label or acronym but apply a
|            local one (e.g. based on the service, project or
|            provider. Ex.: The DutchESS service is using a local
|            variant of the BC classification. It should be called
|            DutchESSC or DutchESS-BC if it is really close to the
|            official scheme).
|
|          + 3.2.3 A subset of an official scheme where terms are
|      unaltered may not be registered separately.
|
|    o 3.3 *Acronyms to be used as DCMI qualifier names *
|
|          + 3.3.1 The acronyms must be unique and start with an
|            initial upper case. Every effort will be made to
|            maintain the short name proposed by the maintaining
|            agency. In case of collisions, a suitable alternative
|            will be chosen in consultation with the maintaining
|            agency.
|
|          + 3.3.2 Existing official acronyms or short names should
|            be used as acronyms.
|
|          + 3.3.3 Official translated versions receive an acronym
|            where a standard language code is added, e.g. DDC-fr.
|            This is necessary since translated versions are rarely
|            fully equivalent. Other translations, if registered,
|            will be assigned an alternative acronym.
|
|    o 3.4 *Specification of scheme versions*
|
|          + 3.4.1 DCMI will register multiple versions of schemes
|            if they appear to be important and/or it is requested
|            by a user applying for registration.
|
|          + 3.4.2 Versioned schemes should be registered and used
|            when there is a considerable probability that
|            databases exist which apply terms and classes
|            belonging to older versions of the scheme.
|
|          + 3.4.3 The official version of the scheme used should
|            be indicated like in the following examples: DDC21,
|DDC21ab-fr (abridged DDC version 21 in French), MSC2000.
|
|Note: In order to stay in sync with DCMI conventions, in these
|guidelines the full name of a scheme is called "label" and an
|acronym or token is called "name".

"Please follow the vocabulary guidelines text Chapter 3 during
your work, especially reg. the making up of the acronym for
DC metadata use (3.3 and 3.4).

The most important steps are:
1) Check our basic requirements (Introduction; 3.1), incl. the
   suitability as Subject element vocabulary
(You might reject the submission immediately after step 1)
2) Verify, correct and complete the information in the record,
   incl. a look on the vocabulary and/or a contact with the
   owner/maintenance agency
3) Establish the label (3.2)
4) Decide upon the acronym (to be used as qualifier name; 3.3)
5) Decide upon the necessity to register scheme versions (3.4)
6) Carry out the registration resp. rejection"

I thought that at least this text was clearly indicating tasks beyond the 
simple submission described in the test mail to the AB and normally expected 
from people outside DCMI.

Roland wrote:
"About process: The proposed review process for "schemes" seems to
require, that one has access to the content of the "scheme" -
or can one be satisfied just with response from the maintainers?"

We need to make sure that the scheme fulfils our few criteria, incl. that it 
exists in real life, that it is created and maintained by recognized entities 
and properly published, and that it is a subject scheme as claimed by the 
submitter.

In most cases, the knowledge we have about the scheme and/or the maintaining 
organisation should be sufficient and not require any inspection of the scheme 
itself in cases where it is not freely and online available.

Look up in lists/databases of schemes and in Google or similar services might 
be a first option and sufficient indication before it is necessary to contact 
the maintainer (if different from the submitter).

If you are in doubt, I can assist in asking colleagues who know many 
established vocabulary schemes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specifically, I think we need to refine the verification
actions into some sort of checklist; articulate some notion of
"reasonable effort" on the part of a verifier; figure out how
we might archive any email correspondence or notes generated
in the course of going through a checklist; and therefore
try to estimate how much time it would typically take a UB
member to completely verify and register an encoding scheme.

Right now I have no clear picture -- will it typically take
fifteen minutes to verify and register a scheme, or half a
day?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2003-06-05: Tom's comments on Encoding Scheme registration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With regard to encoding scheme registration, I have been
pondering a growing list of questions that I would like to
dump here as possible points of discussion in Ithaca:

-- Our use of "Encoding Scheme".  According to our Principles
   and the Namespace Policy, an Encoding Scheme is a "type
   of term" (like Element and Element Refinement).  However,
   Encoding Scheme is sometimes used to denote the vocabulary
   itself -- i.e., the controlled _set_ of terms (maintained
   by others) to which the metadata term (maintained
   by DCMI) refers.  This issue raises troubling issues
   of data-modeling, so I'm almost reluctant to raise it.
   Does anyone else think there may be some hidden traps there?
   Are the Grammatical Principles, Namespace Policy, Usage
   Board Process, and Guidelines for Registering Vocabulary
   Encoding Schemes all consistent in this regard?

-- Etiquette in cases where the owners of a vocabulary
   themselves issue an identifier, such as Rebecca suggested
   might happen with LCSH.  I think we discussed this at a past
   meeting (not sure offhand which one) and I think we ended
   up agreeing that, in general, we should be "good neighbors"
   and defer (through annotations to our documents and perhaps
   through some sort of formal pointing, as in an RDF schema)
   to such alternative identifiers in cases they are declared
   by organizations committed to their maintenance, as would
   certainly be the case with LoC.

-- The revision of the Namespace Policy to add an additional
   one for encoding schemes, which is something the Directorate
   (based on positive feedback from DC-Architecture) is poised
   to do.  The decision to do this (or not) is actually "out
   of scope" for the Usage Board, but I'm wondering if it is
   wise for the Namespace Policy to make the same commitment
   to persistence of registered ESes as to other terms.
   What if we were to get into a situation of conflict with
   the maintainers of a vocabulary for whom a DCMI-maintained
   ES was assigned where -- for whatever reasons, whether for
   IP, trademark, corporate image, or whatever -- they would
   demand that we rename or remove a particular ES?  One hopes
   such things will never happen, but such a situation could
   compel us to violate our own Namespace Policy.  Perhaps we
   should anticipate this possibility by recommending to Stu
   that the Namespace Policy include an escape clause with
   regard to the persistence of terms declared in the context
   of the new "schemes" namespace.

-- As one of postings pointed out, I (for one) find it
   confusing that the registration of ESes is discussed in
   two somewhat overlapping documents -- the Process document
   and your stand-alone Vocabulary Guidelines.  Maybe we
   should fold the latter into the former, or vice versa,
   and simply point from the other document.

-- On the basis of this trial run, I think we should make
   more explicit what "reasonable expectations" we have for
   UB reviewers to double-check or verify the details of
   a submission before giving it approval.  This checklist
   could then become part of our documentation.  If we want
   to require reviewers to send email to the maintainers of
   a vocabulary that is being registered, do we also have
   a procedure for archiving any email exchanged or for at
   least recording a summary of any checks undertaken?

-- It might be helpful, in the Ithaca meeting, to quickly walk
   through the process of registering something.  I know
   this could seem redundant if everyone has done it, but
   it could be a good way to structure a discussion on the
   various steps and to get feedback for possible improvements.

&gt;    itself -- i.e., the controlled _set_ of terms (maintained
&gt;    by others) to which the metadata term (maintained
&gt;    by DCMI) refers.  This issue raises troubling issues
&gt;    of data-modeling, so I'm almost reluctant to raise it.

The interpretation as Class, whose ICEXT blablabla....works.
The sublety is with rdf:subClass cycles (or
owl:equivalentClass) versus owl:sameAs and owl:sameAs seems
too strong in the case discussed on dc:architecture.

&gt;    Does anyone else think there may be some hidden traps there?

Care has to be taken.

&gt;    Are the Grammatical Principles, Namespace Policy, Usage
&gt;    Board Process, and Guidelines for Registering Vocabulary
&gt;    Encoding Schemes all consistent in this regard?

Very hard question.

&gt; -- Etiquette in cases where the owners of a vocabulary
&gt;    themselves issue an identifier, such as Rebecca suggested
&gt;    might happen with LCSH.  I think we discussed this at a past
&gt;    meeting (not sure offhand which one) and I think we ended
&gt;    up agreeing that, in general, we should be "good neighbors"
&gt;    and defer (through annotations to our documents and perhaps
&gt;    through some sort of formal pointing, as in an RDF schema)
&gt;    to such alternative identifiers in cases they are declared
&gt;    by organizations committed to their maintenance, as would
&gt;    certainly be the case with LoC.

Think this is not just a matter of etiquette, but crucial for
interoperability.

Maybe we FIRST should ask the maintainers, whether they want
to issue a declaration by themselves in the future.

 2) We probably need to introduce an additional element to our vocabulary
 template/database records: "Namespace provided by the owner" (of the
 vocabulary).
 It is necessary in the, at the moment, rare case, that the owner of a
 vocabulary provides a formal namespace for it's vocabulary.
 This is different from the URL for a  not machine readable web version of the
 vocabulary.

We need to be careful to distinguish between the namespace in which the
terms in an encoding schem live and the namespace in which the name of the
scheme lives.  I'll refer to these as the 'encoding scheme terms
namespace' and the 'encoding scheme name namespace'.  The two namespaces
may be the same or they may be different.

For example, imagine LoC define a namespace for all the 'terms' in LCSH.
the 'encoding scheme name namespace' would be

<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a>

but the 'encoding scheme terms namespace' might be

<a href="http://www.loc.gov/lcsh/">http://www.loc.gov/lcsh/</a>

(i.e. the URI associated with the LSCH encoding scheme name would be

<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/LSCH">http://purl.org/dc/terms/LSCH</a>

the URI associated with an LCSH term would be

<a href="http://www.loc.gov/lcsh/History">http://www.loc.gov/lcsh/History</a>

).

Of course, there will be encoding schemes where the name of the scheme
lives in someone else's namespace as well.
