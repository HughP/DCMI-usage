    <h2>1. Introduction and Objective</h2>

    <p>This document describes a proposal to the Dublin Core Usage
    Board to provide a specific field within the Dublin Core
    metadata for a bibliographic resource, such as but not limited
    to a journal article, in which to record the bibliographic
    citation information for that resource. It is proposed that
    this field be within a <i>dc:identifier</i> element with a
    <i>citation</i> qualifier.</p>

    <p>The primary purpose of recording the citation information
    for a bibliographic resource is to support discovery of that
    resource, because it would assist with discovery of the
    resource's location. In addition, capturing the bibliographic
    citation information for a resource will support description of
    this type of resource.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that the bibliographic information which
    would be captured in a <i>dc:identifier/citation</i> is the
    complete bibliographic record for the resource itself. This
    proposal is not concerned with capturing citation linking data
    for a related resource. Some background information about
    bibliographic citation information is in <a
    href="#sect4">section 4</a>.</p>

    <p>This proposal does not make any recommendations about the
    encoding of the components of a bibliographic citation within a
    <i>dc:identifier/citation</i> element. A second proposal by the
    DCMI Citation Working Group, 'A Journal Article Bibliographic
    Citation Dublin Core Structured Value' <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>,
    suggests an encoding scheme, but the two proposals are
    independent. Other possible encodings could be an OpenURL <a
    href="#ref3">[3]</a> or a plain text string.</p>
    <a id="sect2" name="sect2"></a> 

    <h2>2. The Proposal</h2>

    <p>It is proposed that bibliographic citation information for a
    journal article, or similar bibliographic resource, should be
    captured within a <i>dc:identifier</i> element with a
    <i>citation</i> refinement.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Bibliographic Resource Identification</h3>

    <p>Using <i>dc:identifier</i> as the element in which to encode
    bibliographic citation information for a resource recognises
    the fact that this citation information effectively
    <i>identifies</i> that resource.</p>

    <p>Consideration has been given to the appropriateness of other
    elements for capturing this information, in particular
    <i>dc:description</i> and <i>dc:relation</i>. Reasons for not
    recommending these elements are given below in <a
    href="#sect4">section 4</a>.</p>

    <h3>2.2 A <i>citation</i> Qualifier</h3>

    <p>It could be argued that a <i>citation</i> qualifier is not
    necessary, and that the information could be encoded in
    <i>dc:identifier</i> without this qualifier. This especially
    could be the case where the citation information is encoded
    according to a standard scheme which implies that the value is
    bibliographic citation information. But there are several
    advantages to using an explicit <i>citation</i> qualifier when
    encoding this type of information in <i>dc:identifier</i>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This proposal makes no recommendation for a particular
      encoding scheme for capturing bibliographic citation
      information. Although the DCMI Citation Working Group intends
      to make some specific recommendations in this area, any
      recommended encoding scheme will not be mandatory, and this
      particular proposal should not depend on any such encoding
      scheme recommendation.</li>

      <li>It will allow for simple text, human readable citations,
      instead of, or as well as, machine readable encodings. These
      textual citations may follow some publisher's convention for
      citations, or they may be in natural text. Without a
      <i>citation</i> qualifier, it would not be obvious that such
      values within a <i>dc:identifier</i> element are
      bibliographic citations.</li>

      <li>Voting during the Plenary session at the DC8 Workshop <a
      href="#ref4">[4]</a> indicated that a large proportion of the
      Dublin Core community is in favour of a new <i>citation</i>
      qualifier for <i>dc:identifier</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>3. Examples</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Dublin Core Record for a Journal Article</h3>

    <p>This is an example of a Dublin Core record for a journal
    article including its bibliographic citation information. This
    example is independent of any syntax recommendation. Any syntax
    used in this example is for clarification purposes only.</p>

    <blockquote>
      dc:title = Studying E-journal User Behavior Using Log
      Files<br />
       dc:creator = Lu, Y<br />
       dc:creator = Apps, A<br />
       dc:subject(scheme=DDC) = 020<br />
       dc:description = Statistical methods for analysing e-journal
      user behaviour.<br />
       dc:publisher = Pergamon<br />
       dcterms:issued(scheme=W3CDTF) = 2000<br />
       dc:type(scheme=DCMIType) = text<br />
       dcterms:medium(scheme=IMT) = application/pdf<br />
       dc:identifier(scheme=URI) = doi:10.1060/xyz.abc<br />
       dc:identifier(scheme=URI) =
      urn:sici:07408188(200010)22:3&lt;311:SEUB&gt;2.0.CO;2-X<br />
       dc:identifier/<i>citation</i> = {<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Journal Title = Library and Information Science
      Research<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Journal Abbreviated Title = LISR<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Journal Volume = 22<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Journal Issue Number = 3<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Journal Issue Date = October 2000<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Pagination = 311-338<br />
       }<br />
       dc:language(scheme=RFC1766) = en<br />
       dcterms:isPartOf(scheme=URI) = urn:issn:0740-8188<br />
       dc:rights = &copy; Elsevier, 2000
    </blockquote>
    <br />
     <br />
     

    <p>In the following example, only the bibliographic citation
    information is given.</p>

    <h3>3.2 A Plain Text Journal Article Citation</h3>

    <p>The bibliographic citation information for the above article
    may be encoded within its Dublin Core record, using plain text,
    in an <i>xhtml</i> <i>meta</i> tag as follows, assuming that
    the new <i>citation</i> element refinement will be in the
    <i>dcterms</i> namespace. This plain text string could choose
    to follow some publication convention.</p>

    <blockquote>
      &lt;meta name="dcterms:citation"<br />
       content="Library and Information Science Research 22(3),
      311-338 (2000)" /&gt;<br />
    </blockquote>
    <br />
     <br />
     

    <p>The same bibliographic citation information encoded in HTML
    would be:</p>

    <blockquote>
      &lt;meta name="DC.Identifier.citation"<br />
       content="Library and Information Science Research 22(3),
      311-338 (2000)"&gt;<br />
    </blockquote>
    <br />
     <br />
     <a id="sect4" name="sect4"></a> 

    <h2>4. Bibliographic Citations</h2>

    <p>This section describes the bibliographic citation
    information for a journal article, but similar considerations
    would apply to capturing within existing Dubin Core elements
    the citation information for other types of bibliographic
    resource.</p>
    <a id="sect4.1" name="sect4.1"></a> 

    <h2>4.1 Journal Article Bibliographic Citation Properties</h2>

    <p>The properties generally used to capture the bibliographic
    citation of a journal article may be identified at three
    distinct levels: the <b>Journal</b> level; the journal
    <b>Issue</b> level (which may also include a journal Volume
    level); and the individual <b>Article</b> level. The following
    table indicates these properties according to this hierarchical
    level, and where appropriate which Dublin Core element is
    already available to record the information.</p>

    <i>Notes</i>: 

    <ul>
      <li>Journal Abbreviated Title may adhere to a published
      scheme, eg. ISO4, Chemical Abstracts, Index Medicus,
      Vancouver, World List. Often it is an abbreviated journal
      title which is included in a reference to an article rather
      than the full title of the journal.</li>

      <li>A journal identifier would usually be an ISSN.</li>

      <li>Issue Numbers are denoted differently in different
      journals, eg. `part'. Some journals are arranged by year, eg.
      12/1999, in which case the year is effectively the
      volume.</li>

      <li>Chronology is the `cover date' as it appears on the cover
      of a printed journal. This may be different from the actual
      date of publication of the issue, which would be encoded in
      <i>dc:date/dct:issued</i>.</li>

      <li>Chronology could be denoted by a season or quarter.</li>

      <li>An article identifier could be: a URL to the actual
      article; a DOI; an article-level SICI; etc. Note that the
      only scheme for <i>dc:identifier</i> ratified by Dublin Core
      is URI, but that global standard identifiers such as ISSN and
      DOI can be encoded as URIs.</li>

      <li>Other information about an article may be recorded within
      other elements of the DC record. For instance, its abstract
      could be captured in <i>dc:description</i>, its language in
      <i>dc:language</i> and keywords or classification information
      in <i>dc:subject</i>.</li>

      <li>Only the most common bibliographic information about an
      article has been included here. A Journal Issue could also
      have an identifier, such as an issue-level SICI, but this is
      less commonly used.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
     <br />
     

    <p>It is apparent from this table that there is currently no
    method within Dublin Core to capture the bibliographic citation
    of a journal article, except by recording the information in an
    ad hoc way within a <i>dc:description</i> element, or by
    capturing the metadata in a hierarchical manner.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Other Possible Solutions</h3>

    <h4>4.2.1 Using <i>dc:description</i></h4>

    <p>The advantages of the <i>dc:description</i> solution would
    be to retain the essential simplicity of Dublin Core, and that
    the information would be presented to someone discovering the
    metadata in a human-readable way. The latter point is
    important, and any solution should provide data to a human
    end-user in a readily understandable form - they may wish to
    find the article on a library shelf. The disadvantage of using
    <i>dc:description</i> is that it becomes difficult to perform
    further machine processing on the discovered metadata, which
    may be required for discovery of the location of the
    article.</p>

    <h4>4.2.2 A Hierarchical Solution</h4>

    <p>It would be possible to partially record the information in
    a hierarchical way, using a <i>dc:relation</i> element to point
    from an article record to a record for its containing issue,
    and similarly from the issue record to that for the containing
    journal. There are two drawbacks to this solution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is no obvious DC element in which to encode the
      pagination information, which pertains to the article itself,
      not to the containing journal issue.</li>

      <li>It may be that there is insufficient knowledge of the
      containing journal and issue to allow for discovery of the
      article from such hierarchical metadata. An end-user would
      expect to receive all the information about an article
      following a search in one piece.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
     <br />
     

    <p>It could be thought that including information about a
    journal in the metadata for an article breaks the `one-to-one'
    rule. However the objective here is not to provide information
    about the journal, but rather to provide a bibliographic
    citation of an article, which effectively identifies it.</p>

    <h4>4.2.3 An Application Profile</h4>

    <p>Another possible method for including in a metadata record
    information which doesn't fit obviously into one of the 15
    elements of the Dublin Core element set (DCMES), or the
    ratified qualifiers, is to introduce application specific
    elements and qualifiers within an application profile <a
    href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Thus an option would be to define a
    `citation' profile and include new elements such as `journal
    title' within it. However, capturing bibliographic citation
    information seems to be a generic, cross-domain problem. The
    bibliographic citation of a journal article is fairly
    fundamental information, required within many subject areas, at
    least for academia and researchers. It is information which is
    becoming increasingly significant with the implementation of
    linking technologies. Therefore it would seem sensible to have
    a best practice convention for capturing journal article
    citation information within Dublin Core metadata using existing
    elements, rather than a proliferation of application profiles
    attempting to solve the same problem in different ways with new
    application specific elements.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Previous Work</h3>

    <p>How to record a bibliographic record for a journal article
    has previously been discussed by an earlier Dublin Core
    Citation Working Group, whose recommendation made after the DC7
    Workshop was 'Citation Qualifier Proposal - 2000' <a
    href="#ref6">[6]</a>, which also includes details of a vote by
    the general DC community at the plenary session at the DC8
    Workshop.</p>
