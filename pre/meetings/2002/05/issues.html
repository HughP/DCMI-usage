==  Several of the documents on the DCMI Recommendations page
    at <A HREF="/documents/#recommendations">http://dublincore.org/documents/#recommendations</A> describe
    "semantics" and, as such, are now under the jurisdiction
    of the Usage Board.  These should be moved or linked to
    <A HREF="/usage/">http://dublincore.org/usage/</A>.   These are:

    <A HREF="/qdcmes/1.0/">http://dublincore.org/qdcmes/1.0/</A>

-- Database attributes: Does the attribute set presented in
   <A HREF="/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/">http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/</A> capture
   the information we will need to record about metadata terms
   in the Vocabulary Management System?  Is the implicit
   attribute set in decisions.html appropriate and adequate?

-- References (footnotes) embedded in term definitions: Note
   that <A HREF="/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/">http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/</A>
   has a "references cited" section, following the
   recommendation Web page for DCMES 1.1.  As we move towards a
   database environment do we need to make element definitions
   more "self-contained" by including all such citations in
   individual term definitions?

-- The case of term names: Andy has argued that we should
   uniformly put "name" tokens into lowercase to follow emerging
   practice in XML and RDF communities.  User guides could
   recommend that applications tolerate mixed-case term names
   for legacy reasons.  If we are going to do this, there is no
   better time than now.  (In this case, a sentence of
   explanation would need to be added to the Introduction of
   <A HREF="/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/">http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/</A>.)

-- If Andy and Pete's XML guidelines are now in line with the
   RDF style of tagging -- the flat {dcterms:alternative}{/...}
   as opposed to the nested
   {dc:title}{dcterms:alternative}{/...}{/...} -- then our
   grammar will need to be reworded accordingly.  Anticipating
   the desirability of doing this, I have tried to describe DCMI
   grammar in the overview terms.html page in a way that does
   not preclude this.

-- Do we want to give the
   <A HREF="/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/">http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/elements-qualifiers/</A>
   document a catchy name, such as "DCMI Dictionary"??

    <A HREF="http://wip.dublincore.org:8080/schemes/index.html">http://wip.dublincore.org:8080/schemes/index.html</A> (Apr 2002)

==  Is Unicode needed?  User interface in several languages?
    (Traugott, Mar 2002)

==  Make all subject vocabulary qualifiers available from DCMI
    Registry?  (Traugott, Mar 2002)

==  "Do all the vocabularies need to be represented in an RDF
    schema eg for validation purposes?" (Traugott, Mar 2002)

==  Should the five "recommended" subject schemes (DDC, UCD,
    LCC, LCSH, MeSH) voted in to the terms namespace remain
    there?  (Traugott, Mar 2002)

==  Should DCMI register encoding schemes for Identifier, or
    force people to register schemes externally to DCMI, either
    as new URI schemes or as URN NIDs or both?  URI, DOI, IDBN,
    ISSN, SICI, and OpenURL have been proposed at various times
    (Andy, Sep 17 2001).  ISSN and ISBN have been formally
    registered as URN Namespaces
    <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces">http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces</A>.  That is
    they are already covered by URI - no further action will be
    needed on our side other than to point this out to working
    groups.  (Roland, Dec 2001)

==  Distinguish between cross-domain and domain-specific for Type
    and Subject encoding schemes?

==  How should DCMI register encoding schemes for elements other than
    Subject -- via Web form or via formal UB review?

==  Encoding scheme "URI" for Description and Rights (Rebecca,
    Oct 12 2001)

==  Articulate guidelines on using URIs as values, for example:
    In Identifier, Relation and Source, the use of 'URI' as an
    encoding scheme means "here is the value and it is a URI".
    In Rights and Description, the use of 'URI' as an encoding
    scheme would mean "the value can be found at the following
    URI".  These two things are not the same and therefore
    shouldn't be encoded using the same mechanism.  (Andy, Oct
    14 2001)

==  Who can register an encoding scheme for their subject
    vocabulary?  Anyone ("my vocabulary")?  A project?  Or only
    "publicly recognized schemas"?  Some sentiment towards tight
    requirements on maintenance bodies.  (Stuart, Diane, Roland,
    Dec 09 2001)

==  Do we need to document registrations of encoding schemes as
    "decisions" in a way analogous to term proposals (assign
    numbers, Web pages, etc)?  Probably not.  (Stuart, Dec 12 2001)

==  Registration of schemes for Type.

==  Should all encoding schemes for Identifier hold also for
    Relation and Source?  Do we need to capture this in our
    documentation?

==  Backlog of subject encoding scheme proposals: SWB (Berthold
    Weiss), mathematical subject headings (Hans Becker)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues related to naming
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==  "Adjective-like" versus "stand-alone" names for element
    refinements.  There seems to be a consensus that names should
    now be "stand-alone" (eg, "alternativeTitle" versus just
    "Alternative").  Do we need to capture this in our
    documentation?  And if we henceforth follow this style, what
    to do with the legacy recommended qualifiers Alternative,
    Created, Valid, Available, Issued, Modified, Spatial, and
    Temporal?  (see Andy posting, June 2001)

==  If we agree henceforth use only stand-alone names, then we have
    following options:
    1) We leave dcq:alternative alone (along with Created, Valid,
       Available, Issued, Modified, Spatial, and Temporal) and switch
       to using stand-alone names in the future.
    2) We change their names in both the Recommendation document and
       in the RDF schema thereof.
    3) We create a redundant set of names (e.g., dcq:alternativeTitle)
       with equivalency relationships to the existing names.
    Andy -- doubts if option 2) is possible.  
         -- likes 3) but doesn't know if it is technically possible - investigate?
         -- could live with 1) though I don't think it is ideal.
    Diane: option 1 is the most practical.
    Andy: should we see
    meta name="DCQ.created" scheme="W3CDTF" content="2001-06-15"
    in HTML meta tags?

==  Case of element names 'title' vs. 'Title' (Andy, Jan 2002)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues for the Web team
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==  We see a requirement to be able to annotate specific
    documents with time-stamped comments -- instead of reissuing
    a document with "errata" attached, simply annotate?

==  For Web Team: we need a simple Web form to submit edited
    documents.

== Perhaps there needs to be a "see also" reference from the term
   declaration to the Usage Guide and to documentation prepared by
   working groups in support of the terms at the proposal stage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues of process and Usage Board role/jurisdiction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==  Need two extra weeks before one-month comment period in order to
    get stuff up on Web, etc.!!!

==  <A HREF="http://128.253.121.110/DC-UB/DC-UBprocess8.html">http://128.253.121.110/DC-UB/DC-UBprocess8.html</A> not yet
    posted on Web site.

==  DCMI has indicated an intention to get into namespace
    hosting; said to be out of scope for UB.  To what extent are
    the policies governing NSes outside the UB jurisdiction
    (naming, persistence, quality control)? (Apr 2002)

==  Potential role of UB in oversight of schemas (RDF and XML
    encodings) used in the DCMI registry or published on the Web
    for use in Semantic Web applications.

==  In approving new term proposals, what weight should UB give
    to working-group process, buy-in, and proven implementation
    experience.  To what extent is UB in job of a
    priori/posteriori.  How strict?  If nobody complains, is
    that sufficient proof to the UB that there are no adverse
    effects?

==  On whose judgement and with whose approval can the UB revise
    and evolve its own process?  Currently, there is a
    placeholder in the process document (Stuart Dec 12 2001)

==  The status of the DCSV "recommendation" itself needs to
    be clarified.  It was never voted on as an approved encoding
    scheme and is not part of the dcterms namespace; rather, it
    was "silently" (and at the time controversially) given
    "recommended" status in circa August 2000 by the Directorate
    on the grounds that its recommendation was implied by our
    approval DCMI Point, Box, and Period.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==  Definition of "title" should be reworded to eliminate an
    inherent assumption that a resource must have a
    well-defined, unique, formal title.  (Roland, Oct 2 2001)

==  CEN/CWA is defining a mapping between DC and ISO 19115.  Do
    we need to look at this?

==  As proposed in 1999, the Format qualifier "medium" is only
    applicable to physical resources and "IMT" is only applicable
    to virtual resources.  Do we need to revise the official
    definitions?  (Andy, Feb 25 2002)

==  RDDL in effect defines its own core element set for resource
    discovery -- one that overlaps in awkward ways with Dublin
    Core.  See <A HREF="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/">http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/</A> and
    <A HREF="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/rddl.rdfs">http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/rddl.rdfs</A>

==  Is it acceptable to use DC metadata to describe non-DLOs
    (such as people, organisations, museum artefacts, events,
    hurricanes, species)?  Or: does DCMI want to say that it is
    *not* acceptable to describe these kinds of things using DC
    metadata?  If not, do we need to indicate somehwere that the
    current DCMI Type list is _not_ intended to be an exhaustive
    list of the kinds of resources that DC can be used to
    describe?  (Andy, Jan 2002)

==  To what extent is the current list of types in the DCMIType
    list an exhaustive list of the kinds of resources that can
    be described using DC metadata?  (Andy, Jan 2002)

==  If it is acceptable to describe non-DLOs using DC metadata,
    does DCMI want to provide any best-practice guidelines for
    how to do it in specific instances, such as for people?  If
    so, what DCMI WGs would do this? (Andy, Jan 2002)

    efforts in the Govt.  of Canada) is assuming - always a
    dangerous practice - that scheme registration will be
    de-centralized; that we will be able to register schemes in our
    domain and count on DCMI to register schemes with broader
    coverage = (e.g.  LCSH, DDC, etc). We are hoping that DCMI
    would refuse to register schemes in our domain and refer such
    attempts to our registry.  Is this decentralized model in line
    with Usage Board thinking on the subject?  Is it likely that
    such an issue would be discussing at the upcoming Usage Board
    meeting at UKOLN?  I'd appreciate your take on this issue.  I
    would certainly also appreciate any comments/suggestions you
    might have regarding the attachment.

==  Should DCMI use the term 'application profile' to describe
    sub-sets of its vocabulary?  Arguments "contra": An application
    profile 'uses' standard terms in an optimised way for a
    particular application; there are an infinite variety of
    application profiles that could be constructed.  DCMI has said
    it is not in the business of 'approving' an unlimited number of
    application profiles DCMI recommendations needs to advise on
    'generic' use of DCMI terms.  Should we 'approve' particular
    application profiles which may well emerge in a fairly arbitrary
    way?  How will DCMI distinguish between application profiles it
    wants to consider in the approval process and those it does
    not??

Andy on identifiers, Jan 2002

    I don't think there was any follow-up to my last posting
    on this subject?  In any case, I've tried to write up
    some guidelines about encoding various commonly used
    identifiers as URIs in DC metadata.  This issue pops up
    on the lists every now ang again, so it would be good to
    have something to refer to.  See

    <A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-identifiers/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-identifiers/</A>

    for my first draft.  I'd like to send this to
    dc-architecture for comment - does that sound
    reasonable?  Would anyone on this list like to disagree
    with my recommendations?

CHANGE REFERENCE TO DCT1 to dcmi-type-vocabulary!!!

Rachel:
    In particular, it is on the agenda in Bath to clarify whether
    a database of "decision" events is a good way to structure
    things.  Perhaps the addition of a "decision" link to a term
    description could trigger a change of internal version of an
    individual term within the VMS.  Instead of linking all of the
    supporting documentation for individual decisions directly to
    the term database, the decision database would be the thing
    that pulls together all supporting documentation and meeting
    notes that contextualize a change.  In the term database,
    then, a new version of the term would be generated, edited
    in accordance with the decision, and the previous version
    would be flagged as obsolete.

    _ Also info on domains in case of domain-specific terms?

    The recent exchange of postings has raised to me some more
    fundamental issues with how we handle status.  I want to post
    about this soon and hope we will have time to discuss in Bath.

    _ We also need to be clear who are the end-users of the VMS. As I see it the
    _ Usage Board is the user of the VMS, whereas other 'users' both human and
    _ machine interact with the registry. 

    I agree.

    _ Another issue is where does the scheme registration take place.... in the
    _ Registry or the VMS.

    In the VMS, I should think.  There will be a need for internal
    change tracking there as well -- might as well use the same model??

Improvements needed in Web documentation:
-- "accessibility" (Liddy), though I'm not sure what this means
   specifically for these documents...?
-- layout: wider spacing on Decisions (Liddy), others...?
-- font: not courier - which ones are "normal"...?
-- URI identifiers for terms should, ideally, not be "clickable"
-- Stuart wants different "view"

Issues related to elements-qualifiers:

==  Should all encoding schemes for Identifier hold also for
    Relation and Source?  Do we need to capture this in our
    documentation?

==  Encoding scheme "URI" for Description and Rights (Rebecca,
    Oct 12 2001)

==  Articulate guidelines on using URIs as values, for example:
    In Identifier, Relation and Source, the use of 'URI' as an
    encoding scheme means "here is the value and it is a URI".
    In Rights and Description, the use of 'URI' as an encoding
    scheme would mean "the value can be found at the following
    URI".  These two things are not the same and therefore
    shouldn't be encoded using the same mechanism.  (Andy, Oct
    14 2001)

Tom proposes:
------------------------------------------------------

-- The chair maintains the Agenda, which cites links to
   all supporting documentation, including JISCMAIL postings,
   that are relevant to the Usage Board agenda points.
   The shepherd or discussion leader for each agenda point
   will choose the relevant materials.

-- Unless IP issues are involved, all of the materials pointed
   to in the agenda should be archived at <A HREF="/">http://dublincore.org/</A>
   after the final pre-meeting version of the agenda has been
   distributed.  [Alternatively, proposals could be archived
   before the public comment period?]

-- A meeting packet of these materials will be distributed as
   a PDF file.

-- After the meeting, the archival version of the Agenda
   should be edited to point to the archival copies of the
   materials cited.

If we agree in Bath that this is a good method, we could use
them to flesh out Section 4.2 of Process.

</PRE>
