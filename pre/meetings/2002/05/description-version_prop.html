      <p align="left">This proposal is for review by Dublin Core
      community. It proposes a new element refinement Version for
      the element DC:Description that is included in the proposed
      DC-Library Application Profile. This review period is 15

            resource is the same as another one. This is

     <b>Best practice:</b> This element refinement would not be
    repeated.</p>

    <p align="left"><b>Issues:</b> This could also be defined as a
    separate element rather than element refinement, but because of
    its importance in identification of the resource the benefits
    of retaining the information when DC-Lib descriptions are
    "dumbed-down" to simple DC argue for refining an element within
    the basic 15. Since it is a essentially a descriptor,
    Description is an appropriate element to refine.</p>
