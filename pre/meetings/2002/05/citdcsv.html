    <h2>1. Introduction and Objective</h2>

    <p>This document describes a proposal to the Dublin Core Usage
    Board for a recommendation to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide a Dublin Core compliant set of metadata
      properties for recording bibliographic citation information
      about journal articles</li>

      <li>Suggest an encoding mechanism for this set of properties
      within a string value</li>
    </ul>
    The suggested encoding scheme is a Dublin Core Structured Value
    (DCSV) <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> called <i>DCMI Cite</i>. This
    encoding scheme could be used as a qualifier for
    <i>dc:identifier</i> and for the proposed new element
    refinement <i>dcterms:citation</i> <a
    href="#ref2">[2]</a>.<br />
     <br />
     

    <p>The purpose of these bibliographic citation properties is
    primarily to support resource discovery. They would assist with
    discovering the location of a resource and thus could support
    citation linking. In addition they could be used for resource
    description to support capture of the complete bibliographic
    record for a journal article.</p>

    <p>One objective of this proposal is to provide a mechanism for
    encoding journal article bibliographic citation information
    within a single text string. This encoding method will be
    suitable for capturing this information within a <i>meta</i>
    tag in the <i>head</i> section of an HTML or xhtml
    document.</p>

    <p>This proposal is a companion to the proposal for "A
    <i>citation</i> Element Refinement for <i>dc:identifier</i>" <a
    href="#ref2">[2]</a>, but neither proposal depends on the
    other.</p>
    <a id="sect2" name="sect2"></a> 

    <h2>2. Bibliographic Citations</h2>

    <p>It should be noted that the bibliographic information
    described here is the complete bibliographic record for the
    resource itself. This proposal is not concerned with capturing
    citation linking data for a related resource.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Journal Article Bibliographic Citation Properties</h3>

    <p>The properties generally used to capture the bibliographic
    citation of a journal article may be identified at three
    distinct levels: the <b>Journal</b> level; the journal
    <b>Issue</b> level (which may also include a journal Volume
    level); and the individual <b>Article</b> level. The following
    table indicates these properties according to this hierarchical
    level, and where appropriate which Dublin Core element is
    already available to record the information.</p>

    <i>Notes</i>: 

    <ul>
      <li>Journal Abbreviated Title may adhere to a published
      scheme, eg. ISO4, Chemical Abstracts, Index Medicus,
      Vancouver, World List. Often it is an abbreviated journal
      title which is included in a reference to an article rather
      than the full title of the journal.</li>

      <li>A journal identifier would usually be an ISSN.</li>

      <li>Issue Numbers are denoted differently in different
      journals, eg. `part'. Some journals are arranged by year, eg.
      12/1999, in which case the year is effectively the
      volume.</li>

      <li>Chronology is the `cover date' as it appears on the cover
      of a printed journal. This may be different from the actual
      date of publication of the issue, which would be encoded in
      <i>dc:date/dct:issued</i>.</li>

      <li>Chronology could be denoted by a season or quarter.</li>

      <li>An article identifier could be: a URL to the actual
      article; a DOI; an article-level SICI; etc. Note that the
      only scheme for <i>dc:identifier</i> ratified by Dublin Core
      is URI, but that global standard identifiers such as ISSN and
      DOI can be encoded as URIs.</li>

      <li>Other information about an article may be recorded within
      other elements of the DC record. For instance, its abstract
      could be captured in <i>dc:description</i>, its language in
      <i>dc:language</i> and keywords or classification information
      in <i>dc:subject</i>.</li>

      <li>Only the most common bibliographic information about an
      article has been included here. A Journal Issue could also
      have an identifier, such as an issue-level SICI, but this is
      less commonly used.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
     <br />
     

    <p>It is apparent from this table that there is currently no
    method within Dublin Core to capture the bibliographic citation
    of a journal article, except by recording the information in an
    ad hoc way within a <i>dc:description</i> element, or by
    capturing the metadata in a hierarchical manner.</p>
    <a id="sect3" name="sect3"></a> 

    <h2>3. The Proposal</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Proposed Encoding for Journal Articles</h3>

    <p>The proposed recommended method for capturing bibliographic
    citation information about journal articles in Dublin Core is
    as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The bibliographic citation information for a journal
      article should be captured within a <i>dc:identifier</i>
      element or within a proposed <i>dcterms:citation</i> element
      refinement, encoded using a <b>DCMI Cite</b> DCSV.</li>

      <li>
        This information may include: 

        <ul>
          <li>Journal Title, Journal Abbreviated Title, Journal
          Identifier</li>

          <li>Volume, Issue Number, Chronology</li>

          <li>Pagination</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>In addition a Journal Identifier or a Journal Issue
      Identifier may be included in a <i>dcterms:isPartOf</i>
      <i>dc:relation</i> element refinement</li>

      <li>All other information about an article, such as its title
      and authors, should be included as appropriate within the 15
      elements of the basic Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</li>
    </ul>
    The proposed <i>DCMI Cite</i> DCSV would be suitable for
    encoding bibliographic citation information within a
    <i>meta</i> tag in the <i>head</i> section of an HTML or xhtml
    document, as well in XML/RDF values. <br />
     <br />
     <a id="sect3.2" name="sect3.2"></a> 

    <h3>3.2 Proposed <i>DCMI Cite</i> Encoding Scheme</h3>

    <p>The proposed recommendation requires a new encoding scheme,
    <i>DCMI Cite</i> which follows the recommended Dublin Core
    Structured Value (DCSV) <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> syntax for
    encoding a list of labelled values within a text string:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>DCMI Cite</dt>

      <dd><b>Name:</b> DCMICite<br />
       <b>Label:</b> DCMI Cite<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> DCMI Cite identifies a journal article by
      its bibliographic citation information.</dd>
    </dl>
    The proposed labels which may be encoded within <i>DCMI
    Cite</i> are: 

    <dl>
      <dt>Journal Title</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> journalTitle<br />
       <b>Definition</b> The title of a journal, ie. a serial
      publication. This may include the sub-title, but not extra
      information such as its affiliation with a society.</dd>

      <dt>Abbreviated Journal Title</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> journalAbbreviatedTitle<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> The abbreviated title of a journal, such
      as it may appear in a reference list It may follow some
      recommended scheme such as ISO4, Chemical Abstracts, Index
      Medicus, Vancouver, World, but the scheme would not be
      encoded within <i>DCMI Cite</i>. List.</dd>

      <dt>Journal Identifier</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> journalIdentifier<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> A global standard identifier of a
      journal. This would usually be an ISSN, but may follow some
      other standard such as CODEN.</dd>

      <dt>Volume</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> journalVolume<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> A number of a journal volume, in roman or
      arabic form, as it appears on the cover.</dd>

      <dt>Issue Number</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> journalIssueNumber<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> The issue, part or number which denotes a
      particular issue of a journal, as it appears on the cover. In
      many cases this indicates a part of a journal volume.</dd>

      <dt>Chronology</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> journalIssueDate<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> The formal date of a particular issue of
      a journal, as it appears on the cover.</dd>

      <dt>Pagination</dt>

      <dd><b>Label:</b> pagination<br />
       <b>Definition:</b> The inclusive page range of an article
      within a particular journal issue, from first to last page.
      (For an electronic-only journal article, this property could
      record an article number.)</dd>
    </dl>
    Note that this recommendation is based on the print model of
    journal publishing. At the present time, recording the position
    of an article within a printed journal is the generally used
    model and a requirement for reference linking. Most journals
    are still published according to this model, and many cited
    articles appear in older journals which were originally
    published in print. Where articles published in electronic-only
    journals are cited the pagination and possible the issue
    numbering information is irrelevant, though it would by
    necessity be replaced by some other numbering. This issue will
    be considered in the future by the DCMI Citation Working
    Group.<br />
     <br />
     

    <p>The DCSV syntax, to be used for <i>DCMI Cite</i> defines a
    list of 'label=value' pairs embedded within a text string. This
    syntax is a DCMI recommendation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>equals-signs (=) separate plain-text labels of structured
      value-components from the values themselves</li>

      <li>semi-colons (;) separate value-components within a
      list</li>

      <li>equals-signs (=) and semi-colons (;) required within a
      value should be backslash (\) escaped</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
     <br />
     <a id="sect3.3" name="sect3.3"></a> 

    <h3>3.3 Best Practice Encoding</h3>

    <p>In the spirit of Dublin Core all the introduced properties
    are optional and repeatable with no prescribed order. However,
    common sense indicates that a bibliographic citation must
    contain sufficient information to identify a resource, and that
    the citation should not include conflicting details. This is
    generally understood to be a minimum of journal identification,
    journal volume and article start page, although this may vary
    depending on the organisation of the journal, eg. some journal
    issues always number from page one making the issue number
    significant. In order to satisfy the `dumb-down' principle it
    is recommended that a `DCMI Cite' contain sufficient details to
    identify the resource. Taking these considerations into
    account, it is recommended that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A citation should contain at least the minimum
      information to identify the article</li>

      <li>A citation should contain at least one of: journalTitle;
      journalAbbreviatedTitle; or journalIdentifier</li>

      <li>The only properties which may be repeated are:
      journalAbbreviatedTitle; journalIssueNumber; and
      journalIssueDate</li>
    </ul>
    It is further suggested that: 

    <ul>
      <li>journalIdentifier should be used within a citation only
      when journalTitle or journalAbbreviatedTitle are not known.
      If a journal identifier, such as ISSN, is required in
      addition to the journal title it should be included in a
      <i>dcterms:isPartOf</i> element.</li>

      <li>Repeated journalIssueDate or journalAbbreviatedTitle
      should not specify conflicting information. It would be
      sensible to repeat journalIssueDate only where the
      information was required in different formats, eg. Spring
      2001 and 2001-04.</li>

      <li>Repeated journalIssueNumbers could be used for `parts of
      parts', eg. Volume 6, Issue 9, Part 2. Note that an
      alternative representation of this example could be: Volume
      6, Issue 9/2.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>4 Examples</h2>

    <h3>4.1 A Journal Article Metadata Record</h3>

    <p>This is an example of a Dublin Core record for a journal
    article including its bibliographic citation information. This
    example is independent of any syntax recommendation apart from
    the DCMI Cite DCSV. Any other syntax and any line breaks used
    in this example are for clarification purposes only.</p>

    <blockquote>
      dc:title = Studying E-journal User Behavior Using Log
      Files<br />

    <h3>4.2 An <i>xhtml</i> Example</h3>

    <p>This is an example of two properties within an <i>xhtml</i>
    metadata record for the same journal article which define its
    bibliographic citation. The first property,
    <i>dcterms:citation</i>, uses the <i>DCMI Cite</i> DCSV
    encoding scheme. [Note that line breaks are for clarification
    only.]</p>

    <h2>5. Other Possible Solutions</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Using <i>dc:description</i></h3>

    <p>The advantages of the <i>dc:description</i> solution would
    be to retain the essential simplicity of Dublin Core, and that
    the information would be presented to someone discovering the
    metadata in a human-readable way. The latter point is
    important, and any solution should provide data to a human
    end-user in a readily understandable form - they may wish to
    find the article on a library shelf. The disadvantage of using
    <i>dc:description</i> is that it becomes difficult to perform
    further machine processing on the discovered metadata, which
    may be required for discovery of the location of the
    article.</p>

    <h3>5.2 A Hierarchical Solution</h3>

    <p>It would be possible to partially record the information in
    a hierarchical way, using a <i>dc:relation</i> element to point
    from an article record to a record for its containing issue,
    and similarly from the issue record to that for the containing
    journal. There are two drawbacks to this solution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is no obvious DC element in which to encode the
      pagination information, which pertains to the article itself,
      not to the containing journal issue.</li>

      <li>It may be that there is insufficient knowledge of the
      containing journal and issue to allow for discovery of the
      article from such hierarchical metadata. An end-user would
      expect to receive all the information about an article
      following a search in one piece.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
     <br />
     

    <p>It could be thought that including information about a
    journal in the metadata for an article breaks the `one-to-one'
    rule. However the objective here is not to provide information
    about the journal, but rather to provide a bibliographic
    citation of an article, which effectively identifies it.</p>

    <h3>5.3 An Application Profile</h3>

    <p>Another possible method for including in a metadata record
    information which doesn't fit obviously into one of the 15
    elements of the Dublin Core element set (DCMES), or the
    ratified qualifiers, is to introduce application specific
    elements and qualifiers within an application profile<a
    href="#ref4">[4]</a>. Thus an option would be to define a
    `citation' profile and include new elements such as `journal
    title' within it. However, capturing bibliographic citation
    information seems to be a generic, cross-domain problem. The
    bibliographic citation of a journal article is fairly
    fundamental information, required within many subject areas, at
    least for academia and researchers. It is information which is
    becoming increasingly significant with the implementation of
    linking technologies. Therefore it would seem sensible to have
    a best practice convention for capturing journal article
    citation information within Dublin Core metadata using existing
    elements, rather than a proliferation of application profiles
    attempting to solve the same problem in different ways with new
    application specific elements. However, the bibliographic
    citation propoerties identified within this proposal, and
    suggested for encoding within a <i>DCMI Cite</i> DCSV would
    form the basis of a Citation Profile suitable for encoding in
    XML or RDF.</p>

    <h3>5.4 OpenURL</h3>

    <p>The emerging OpenURL <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> standard may
    provide an alternative encoding scheme for capturing journal
    article bibliographic citation information within a single
    string. However, there are currently reasons for not
    recommending OpenURL as a citation encoding scheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>OpenURL is not yet a standard and so is not yet stable.
      Although it would be possible to make recommendations on
      using the original draft version of OpenURL, now "pinned
      down" as version 0.1, it is likely that Version 1.0 will be
      different. The current timescale for OpenURL is for the NISO
      Committee to produce a standard for voting by NISO members by
      Autumn 2002.</li>

      <li>It is possble that OpenURL Version 1.0 may not include
      all the properties of a journal article which have been
      identified in this proposal. Metadata included in an OpenURL
      is for linking purposes, rather than for metadata
      description.</li>
    </ul>
    When OpenURL becomes a NISO/ANSI standard, the DCMI Citation
    Working Group will produce guidelines for its use as a possible
    value for a <i>citation</i> identifier. But it would be an
    alternative to the proposed <i>DCMI Cite</i> DCSV rather than a
    replacement for it. 

    <ul>
      <li>The proposed <i>DCMI Cite</i> DCSV is relatively
      human-readable, whereas an OpenURL is more cryptic. OpenURL
      is suitable only for situations where the citation is for
      machine processing.</li>

      <li>In situations where bibliographic citation information is
      to be keyed manually, it would be difficult to use an
      OpenURL, whereas using <i>DCMI Cite</i> would be
      straightforward. It is possible that this keyed information
      would also be for machine processing, so a plain text
      citation would be unsuitable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.5 Previous Work</h3>

    <p>How to record a bibliographic record for a journal article
    has previously been discussed by an earlier Dublin Core
    Citation Working Group, whose recommendation made after the DC7
    Workshop was 'Citation Qualifier Proposal - 2000' <a
    href="#ref6">[6]</a>, which also includes details of a vote by
    the general DC community at the plenary session at DC8
    Workshop.</p>
