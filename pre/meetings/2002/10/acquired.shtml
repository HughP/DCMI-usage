    While it might appear that there is overlap between the
    proposed 'dateAccepted' and the DCMI refinement 'dateAcquired',
    the two terms serve different purposes. Date.Acquired is about
    the resource itself being received, 'dateAccepted' is about the
    content of the resource being approved. One resource may have
    different values for dateAcquired and dateAccepted, so two
    refinements are needed. for example a resource arrives in an
    organisation on a given date, but cannot be formally accepted
    until it has been reviewed by a committee. Its status changes
    when it is accepted. At no point does the content of the
    resource change during this process.

    <p>21 march 2002<br />
    Chris Croome:<br />
    Acquisition Date. Should this work like a DCMI Period [2],
    initially with just a start date and then an end date for when
    the organisation gets reorganised and renamed and the resource
    gets passed on? Perhaps AquiredDate and AquiredBy might make
    sense as refinements of Publisher? I don't know if this was
    ever considered? But with the confusing speed at with UK
    government departments get renamed and reorganised more
    flexibilty might make sense for the Date Acquired?<br />

    Date.acquired - shouldn't the encoding scheme be "W3CDTF"
    instead of "ISO 8601" to match the Date encoding scheme in DC
    Qualifiers?<br />
    <br />

    John Roberts<br />
    Date/Acquired - We are unsure as to whether this is in fact
    discovery mertadata or management metadata.</p>
