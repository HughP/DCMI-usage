Review of Eprints/SWAP Profile

RESOLVED To complete a first-run review of Eprints/SWAP [1]
by late July.

Rationale: we assume that doing the review will reveal 
places where the Review Criteria [2] need to be tightened,
expanded, or otherwise edited.  Having draft reviews by 
July will allow us time for revisions and a second round
of reviews if necessary.

Method: Given five task areas, assign two reviewers per area.
Provisional assignments (pending agreement from Andrew and
Akira):

-- Objectives and Scope, Functional Requirements, Domain Model
   Andrew and Akira

-- DSP templates and constraints
   Joe and Pete

-- DSP metadata terms referenced
   Diane and Julie

-- Syntax guidelines
   Tom and Stefanie
