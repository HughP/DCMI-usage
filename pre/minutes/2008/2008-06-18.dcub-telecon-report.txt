-- Use of dc:source in SKOS primer
   http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0806&L=dc-usage&P=1727
   http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0806&L=dc-usage&P=1980

   Agree that the example used in draft SKOS Primer is
   a stretch.  In practice, use of dc:source is often
   discouraged.  Tom will suggest using another example.
