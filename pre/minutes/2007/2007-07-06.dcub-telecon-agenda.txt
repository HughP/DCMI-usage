Agenda - Singapore - Aug 28-29

-- Changes to terms of the DCTERMS namespace (Diane)

   "Revisions to DCMI Metadata Terms" were published for
   Public Comment on Monday, 2 July [1].  These will be discussed
   and finalized in Singapore.  Sources were:

   -- Barcelona decisions [2]
   -- Changes made between DCTERMS-2006 [6] and NISO Z39-85-2007 [5]

-- Domains and ranges (shepherd?)

   The Domain Vocabulary has been revised in light of
   Barcelona decisions [1] and posted for Public Comment
   through 30 July [2].  A range of rdfs:Literal has been
   proposed for dcterms:identifier [3].  Pete has written
   a note describing the "special cases" (title, date,
   description, and their subproperties) [4]. (From the
   notes: "There are two audiences for this comment: (1)
   multiple script communities and (2) SW community asking:
   best practice for unspecified ranges.")

-- Application profile review criteria (Joe, Stuart)

   ACTION 2007-06-08: Joe to revise
   http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/ProfileReviewCriteria
   in light of:
   http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/CollectionsProfileReviewNotes
   
   ACTION 2007-03-17: Stuart and Joe revise Term Decision Tree:
   http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/TermDecisionTree.
   (Note: the difference is basically String vs. Thing.)

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Joe to draft a document discussing
   issues related to principles and purpose of UB decision-making.
   (The context was the decision to define ISO639-2 as a set of codes.)
   Joe will work with Stuart on this (2007-06-08).

   ACTION 2007-03-17: Stuart and Joe to write
   a one-page explanation differentiating
   VES and SES, vet with Pete Johnston.  See:
   http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/Encoding-schemes.txt.
   Agreed: We need a deeper level of description and
   differentiation between VES and SES, including definitions.
   If you have a something already, how do you tell if it is
   VES or SES.  If an Encoding Scheme tells you what a value
   string it it's a SES.  If Encoding Scheme defines a class
   of values, then it is a VES (e.g., concepts).  For example,
   if you develop a list of educational levels, and if you
   define a list of strings, then you're defining an SES.
   If you define a set of concepts and assign URIs to them (as
   best practice), then you're defining a VES.  Best practice
   in this scenario is to define a set of concepts with URIs
   rather than a set of strings.  Agreed that DC-Education
   is a great test-bed for these concepts.  SES is a datatype
   in RDF.  VES is like conceptScheme in SKOS, only not limited
   to concepts.  For discussion: VES is a set of concepts that,
   once in metadata, allows editors to handle assertion by
   adding things to it.  SES is a set of strings.

-- Revisions to RDF schemas in light of DCAM

-- FOAF (Andrew)
   -- Comparison with Agents requirements (Andrew)
   -- Long-term preservation issues

-- Structure of DCMI Metadata Terms document (Tom)

   The document DCMI Metadata Terms 
   (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) needs to
   be restructured in light of DCAM changes.  See proposed
   outline at
   http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DcmiTermsOutline.
