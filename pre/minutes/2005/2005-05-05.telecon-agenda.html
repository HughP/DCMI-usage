Dear all,

It didn't really sink in after last week's call that the time
shift with regard to UTC was not just a week-long anomaly, but
a seasonal thing.  

We agreed to have the telecon at 1400 UTC.  However, the times
that most of you probably wrote down on your schedules are one
hour earlier.

I propose that we meet at the times listed in column A --
1400 in Bath, etc.  If you had actually made the adjustment
and planned to attend at the time in column B, and you cannot
make it at time A (or do not read this message in time), then
I will stay on the line for the second hour and have a second
telecon with whoever is there.

    Slot      A                 B
    UTC       1300!             1400
    Bath      1400 is really -&gt; 1500
    Berlin    1500 is really -&gt; 1600
    Tokyo     2300 is really -&gt; 2400
    Seattle   0600 is really -&gt; 0700
    Ithaca    0900 is really -&gt; 1000

My humble apologies for the confusion!

The agenda, attached below, is very simple: to prioritize
work items for the agenda in Washington, especially in light
of the DCMI Extension Namespaces draft circulated yesterday.

I will post a draft agenda shortly before the call.

Tom
