Review of Accessibility properties (Andrew)

Discussed proposal from Andrew
-- https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0903&L=DC-USAGE&P=2658

Now up on the wiki as
http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/AccessibilityProposal.

Pete: not clear from the definition what the expected range is.
At some point the group was calling it Access Modes - bucket of
things that serve certain functions. We have had problems with
other properties, such as Rights, which we eventually clarified
to be a Statement. I see parallels there.

Andrew: Do not think we can equate vocabulary to modes of access.
Just a statement about characteristics of a resource.  Definition
could use the word "statement".

Tom presents his posting at
https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0904&L=DC-USAGE&P=4264
Sees a parallel with the discussion of whether properties are
"relevant for resource discovery" and asking (as here) whether
characteristics of a resource are "relevant for accessibility".
Why, then, would "language" not fit the definition - or does it
in fact? He understands the point to be that descriptions can
help a user determine whether the resource is one that they can
access and use given limitations in their physical or virtual
capacity to do so.  But that characterization still focuses on
limitations in the users capacity, not characteristics of the 
resource itself.  Could the resource itself be characterized in
terms of "limitations"?

Tom suggests that "auditoryOnly" could be take to refer to "the
notion that the resource is limited in accessibility to auditory
mode". Or: "the notion that the resource is accessible within
the limitation of auditory mode".

Pete suggests: "the notion that access to the resource requires
the sense of hearing".

Andrew cites Zimmermann to the effect that "auditoryOnly" means
that "The resource contains some significant content available
as sounds only."

Tom's phone line dropped and he could not re-enter, so the
meeting concluded with a pointer to the poll for the next
telecon. Discussion of Accessibility to continue on the list.
