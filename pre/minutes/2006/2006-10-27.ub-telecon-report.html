DECISION: dc:type definition to read:

       The nature or genre of the resource.

ACTION 2006-10-27 Tom to change definition of dc:type to read
"The nature or genre of the resource."


Some discussion notes from IRC:


Andy: does our proposed new definition narrow the definition?
Genre appears in both, so we can ignore it.  Is "nature"
broader than "functional..." etc?  Agree that simplest solution
is to go back to original wording.

Second issue: does a definition of dc:type (genre or nature)
semantically equivalent to saying it is a "class" -- a
fuzzier issue.  Better off focusing today on question of
narrowing or not.  Suggest we go back to the old wording.

Diane: "Nature" is any kind of categorization that is useful.

Joe: thought we were trying to clarify. Type has served
multiple purposes - do we want that?

Andrew: Type does have multiple uses - for ten years...

Joe: Type is used in DCAM for any instance-class
relationship. Are we trying to fit a definition for that
function?

Andy: This proposal comes from my work on domains and
ranges. What we intended is something like the proposed
definition. Danger: people may have interpreted type more
broadly because current definition is so fuzzy.  Danger that
in practice we are narrowing if we adopt the more specific
definition.

Diane: just clear up the problematic part ("content of")
and leave the rest to user documentation.  We cannot test
this against the implementations of the world...

Andy: Going the whole hog: dc:type is class of the resource.
Danger we sit down and say "nature and genre", then big
discussion.  Gut feeling: leave unchanged and fuzzy and find
some other way of indicating class in the Abstract Model.

Andrew: happy to have a loose definition, just concerned
about ramifications for future decisions.
