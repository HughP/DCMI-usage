Travel Arrangements

     The OCLC campus is located in Dublin, Ohio, a suburban community
     near Columbus, Ohio USA.

          Arbitrarily selected information about the general area
          may be found by the following links on the Central Ohio
          Information page.

     The Central Ohio area is served by Port Columbus International
     Airport.

          Ground Transportation

             * OCLC's recommended option is to make a reservation
               with Royal Livery service. The OCLC corporate rate
               is comparable to the cost of a taxicab ride.
               Please follow this link for complete information
               about this option.

             * You may also choose to make your own local
               transportation arrangements. General information
               about ground transportation options at Port
               Columbus International Airport is available on the
               airport's home page. (Choose "What ground
               transportation is available?" from the drop-down
               menu at the top of the main page.)



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lodging

     Please make your hotel reservations as early as possible. DCMI
     Usage Board meeting participants qualify for the OCLC corporate
     rate of US$85.00/night at:

     Wyndham Dublin Hotel
     600 Metro Place North
     Dublin, Ohio 43017
     (614) 764-2200 or 1-800-WYNDHAM (996-3426)
     fax: (614) 764-1213

     Please note:

        * The Wyndham is close to OCLC and has complimentary
          transportation to OCLC available.
             o Please make transportation arrangements with the
               Wyndham desk upon check-in, then call the desk to
               confirm the arrangements 15 minutes prior to your
               desired departure time. (Allow approximately 15 minutes
               transportation time between the Wyndham and OCLC.)

        * When you book a reservation, please tell them that you are
          coming to a meeting at OCLC. This should qualify you for the
          OCLC corporate rate.

        * Please be aware that there is another, large meeting at OCLC
          at the same time as ours. There is no list of reservations
          for our meeting. Thus, if you are told that your name is not
          on a list, please say that you are with the DCMI Usage
          Board, rather than the other meeting at OCLC.
             o In order to secure the OCLC corporate rate, please book
               your reservation by telephone rather than through the
               online registration facility.
