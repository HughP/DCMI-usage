1. <a id="one." name="one.">Usage Board Membership</a> <font size="-2">[<a href="#top">top</a>]</font>

- 1.1. The UB will consist of at least seven and no more than eleven people (nine is ideal) appointed by the DCMI Directorate.
- 1.2. Usage Board member terms shall be for two years, renewable once. Initial appointments will be made so as to stagger terms.
- 1.3. Members should be selected based on the following criteria: 
  - 1.3.1. Knowledgeable concerning the development history and purpose of the DC element set and its relationship to the metadata world at large;
  - 1.3.2. Related to a metadata community relevant to DCMI;
  - 1.3.3. Willing and able to commit time and energy to the functions of the UB;
  - 1.3.4. Able to communicate verbally and in writing in English well enough to prepare documents and discuss complex issues in a group setting;
  - 1.3.5. Geographic and domain distribution of members is relevant but will not override other criteria.
- 1.4. The UB Chair will be appointed from one of the membership by the DCMI Directorate. The term of the chair shall be for two years, renewable once.
- 1.5. For internal communication the UB uses the closed mailing list dc-usage@jiscmail.ac.uk. The messages are archived and publicly available at [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html).

2. <a id="two." name="two.">Meetings</a> <font size="-2">[<a href="#top">top</a>]</font>

    - 2.1.1.1. One meeting should be scheduled during the annual DC general workshop/conference.
    - 2.1.1.2. The second should be scheduled at a different time of the year, preferably close to other conferences, so as to make attendance convenient for as many members as possible.
    - 2.1.1.3. Scheduling should be done far enough in advance so that as many members as possible may be present.
- 2.2. Funding for meetings should be supported as much as possible by DCMI.
- 2.3. Attendance by members 
  - 2.3.1. Members must attend at least one meeting in a given year to maintain membership in good standing.
  - 2.3.2. Members who miss two meetings in succession may be replaced by the DC Directorate.
- 2.4. Attendance by others 
  - 2.4.1. Attendance at UB meetings by other than the UB is by invitation.

  - 4.2.2. Structure of the UB website is similar to a working group page with an issues, forums and resources section. If necessary, an UB internal section can be password protected.
  - 4.2.3. Historic documents relevant to the UB work, like voting proposals and results from the first DC Qualifier voting will be archived at the same page.
  - 4.2.4. Results of the UB work which take the form of official DCMI documents (working drafts, proposed recommendations and recommendations) are made available and archived at: [http://dublincore.org/documents/](http://dublincore.org/documents/) as all the other similar documents.

    - 5.2.2.1. A summary history of the post-announcement discussion
  - <a id="five.3." name="five.3.">5.3.</a> Guidelines for proposal developers  
 The following criteria are offered as guidelines for working groups that are developing a proposal -- they reflect criteria that the Usage Board will use in its decision-making. They do not constitute further requirements for the formal documentation of a proposal. 
    - 5.3.1. Criteria for evaluating a term proposal 
      - 5.3.1.1. Clarity 
        - 5.3.1.1.1. Can the term be clearly defined?
        - 5.3.1.1.2. Can the semantics of the proposed element or element qualifier be expressed precisely, unambiguously, and briefly?
      - 5.3.2. Practicality 
        - 5.3.2.1. Is the term practical?
        - 5.3.2.2. How difficult would it be for people creating metadata to comprehend the semantics of the proposed element or element qualifier and to apply it reasonably in the description of resources?
      - 5.3.3. Placement 
        - 5.3.3.1. Does the term refine an existing element?
        - 5.3.3.2. If the proposed term is an element, can it reasonably be handled as effectively as an element or value qualifier for an existing element?
        - 5.3.3.3. Are there alternative ways of implementing the term? Within the conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set (i.e., element/element qualifiers and value/value qualifiers), are there alternative ways to achieve the ends sought?
      - 5.3.4. Needs 
        - 5.3.4.1. Is there a clear requirement in existing implementations for the term in support of resource discovery?
        - 5.3.4.2. Is there a demonstrated need for the proposed element, element qualifier, or value qualifier?
        - 5.3.4.3. Are there existing implementations or controlled vocabularies, etc., supporting the term?
      - 5.3.5. Fit with other elements/qualifiers 
        - 5.3.5.1. Follows existing principles of qualification
        - 5.3.5.2. Is well-formed
        - 5.3.5.3. Does not conflict with or create ambiguity with regard to existing elements, or qualifiers
        - 5.3.5.4. Does not create problems for existing legacy implementations if those implementations have followed recommended practice
