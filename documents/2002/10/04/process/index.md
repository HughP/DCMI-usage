**1.3.4.** Able to communicate verbally and in writing in English well enough to prepare documents and discuss complex issues in a group setting;   
**1.3.5.** Geographic and domain distribution of members is relevant but will not override other criteria.   
**1.4.** The UB Chair will be appointed from one of the membership by the DCMI Directorate. The term of the chair shall be for two years, renewable once.   
**1.5.** For internal communication the UB uses the closed mailing list dc-usage@jiscmail.ac.uk. The messages are archived and publicly available at [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html).  

**2.** <a id="two." name="two.">Meetings</a> <font size="-2">[<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#top">top</a>]</font>

**2.1.** Scheduling 
**2.1.1.** Meetings should be at least twice a year.   

**2.1.1.1.** One meeting should be scheduled during the annual DC general workshop/conference.   
**2.1.1.2.** The second should be scheduled at a different time of the year, preferably close to other conferences, so as to make attendance convenient for as many members as possible.   
**2.1.1.3.** Scheduling should be done far enough in advance so that as many members as possible may be present.   
**2.2.** Funding for meetings should be supported as much as possible by DCMI.   
<font color="#ff0000"><b>2.3.</b> Meeting 
agenda<br></font>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>2.3.1.</b> The UB Chair maintains the agenda, 
    which cites links to relevant supporting documentation, including JISCMAIL 
    postings.<br><b>2.3.2.</b> All materials pointed to in the agenda are 
    archived at http://dublincore.org after the final pre-meeting version of the 
    agenda has been distributed. After the meeting, the archive version of the 
    agenda is edited to point to these archive copies. </font> **2.4.** Attendance by members   

**2.4.1.** Members must attend at least one meeting in a given year to maintain membership in good standing.   
**2.4.2.** Members who miss two meetings in succession may be replaced by the DC Directorate.   
**2.5.** Attendance by others   

**2.5.1.** Attendance at UB meetings by other than the UB is by invitation.  

**2.5.1.1.** Interested attendees should request an invitation via the UB Chair or the Managing Director.   
**2.5.2.** Participation in discussion of proposals by any interested parties is encouraged.   
**2.6.** Agenda preparation and distribution  

**2.6.1.** The UB chair is responsible for preparing the meeting agendas and assigning shepherds to proposals.   
**2.6.2.** Agenda items shall include the name and email address of the UB member responsible for shepherding the proposal through the UB process.  
**2.6.3.** Agendas shall be available on the UB page of the DCMI website.   
**2.7.** Meeting minutes and decisions   

**2.7.1.** Minutes of discussion points and decisions shall be drafted by a note-taker and posted to the DCMI website.   
**2.7.2.** Important decisions will be assigned a number for citation purposes and documented on the DCMI website.

<font color="#ff0000"><b>3.1.</b> <strong style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><i>Recommended</i>:</strong> Element, Element 
  Refinement, and DCMI Type Vocabulary terms useful for resource discovery 
  across domains.<br><b>3.2.</b> <strong style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><i>Conforming</i>:</strong> Element and Element 
  Refinement terms for which an implementation community has a demonstrated need 
  and which conform to the grammar of Elements and Element Refinements, though 
  without necessarily meeting the stricter criteria of usefulness across domains 
  or usefulness for resource discovery. <br><b>3.3.</b> <strong style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><i>Obsolete</i>:</strong> For Element and Element 
  Refinement terms that have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete. 
  Such terms will remain in the registry for use in interpreting legacy 
  metadata.<br><b>3.4.</b> <strong style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><i>Registered</i>:</strong> Used for vocabulary

**4.** <a id="four." name="four.">Documentation</a> <font size="-2">[<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#top">top</a>]</font>

**4.1.** Documentation   

**4.1.1.** Important documents like UB membership, meeting agendas, meeting minutes, proposals to the UB, voting or decision documents and results (if not part of minutes) and similar are archived as separate documents in an area of the DCMI web site devoted to the UB.  
**4.1.2.** Structure of the UB website is similar to a working group page with an issues, forums and resources section. If necessary, an UB internal section can be password protected.   
**4.1.3.** Historic documents relevant to the UB work, like voting proposals and results from the first DC refinement voting will be archived at the same page.  
**4.1.4.** Results of the UB work which take the form of official DCMI documents (working drafts, proposed recommendations and recommendations) are made available and archived at: <font color="#ff0000"> </font> [http://dublincore.org/documents/](http://dublincore.org/documents/) as all the other similar documents.  
**4.1.5.** The UB page maintains links to all XML/RDF schemas of UB-maintained namespaces held on the DCMI Web site.

**5.2.2.** To be supplied by the UB shepherd:   

**5.2.2.1.** A summary history of the post-announcement discussion   
**<a id="five.3." name="five.3.">5.3.</a>** Guidelines: The following criteria are offered as guidelines for working groups that are developing a proposal -- they reflect criteria that the Usage Board will use in its decision-making. They do not constitute further requirements for the formal documentation of a proposal.  

**5.3.1.** Criteria for evaluating a term proposal   

**5.3.1.1.** Clarity   

**5.3.1.1.1.** Can the term be clearly defined?   
**5.3.1.1.2.** Can the semantics of the proposed element or element refinement be expressed precisely, unambiguously, and briefly?   
**5.3.1.2.** Practicality   

**5.3.1.2.1.** Is the term practical?  
**5.3.1.2.2.** How difficult would it be for people creating metadata to comprehend the semantics of the proposed element or element refinement and to apply it reasonably in the description of resources?   
**5.3.1.3.** Placement   

**5.3.1.3.1.** Does the term refine an existing element?   
**5.3.1.3.2.** If the proposed term is an element, can it reasonably be handled as effectively as an element or value refinement for an existing element?   
**5.3.1.3.3.** Are there alternative ways of implementing the term? Within the conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set (i.e., element/element refinements and value/value refinements), are there alternative ways to achieve the ends sought?   
**5.3.1.4.** Needs   

**5.3.1.4.1.** Is there a clear requirement in existing implementations for the term in support of resource discovery?  
**5.3.1.4.2.** Is there a demonstrated need for the proposed element, element refinement, or value refinement?   
**5.3.1.4.3.** Are there existing implementations or controlled vocabularies, etc., supporting the term?   
**5.3.1.5.** Fit with other elements/refinements   

**5.3.1.5.1.** Follows existing principles of refinement  
**5.3.1.5.2.** Is well-formed   
**5.3.1.5.3.** Does not conflict with or create ambiguity with regard to existing elements, or refinements   
**5.3.1.5.4.** Does not create problems for existing legacy implementations if those implementations have followed recommended practice   
**5.4.** Decision tree for assessing the need for a new term

**5.5.4.** Shepherds  

**5.5.4.1.** Each proposal shall be assigned a shepherd by the UB chair from among the UB membership.  
**5.5.4.2.** Shepherds should have knowledge of the proposal issues or be connected to the WG originating the proposal.  
**5.5.4.3.** Responsibilities   

**5.5.4.3.1.** Monitor discussion on relevant lists (shepherds should be members of the relevant DC WG list during the time of consideration of a proposal).  
**5.5.4.3.2.** Summarize the comment period discussion and points of contention of the proposal for the UB, either verbally at the meeting or in writing prior to the meeting (preferred).   
**5.5.4.3.3.** Serve as liaison to the relevant WG or community during the time the proposal is under discussion and after a decision has been made.   
**5.5.4.3.4.** Recommend to the UB any further action after a decision has been made on the proposal.   
**5.5.4.3.5.** Prepare registration information for the DCMI Web Team.  
**5.5.4.3.6.** Prepare draft of UB official decision on the proposal for review and approval by the UB.  
**5.5.5.** Comment period   

**5.5.5.1.** Comment period on proposals should be managed on the DC-General list.   
**5.5.5.2.** Comment periods should be at least one month.

**6.2.1.** Their knowledge of a particular scheme or vocabulary   
**6.2.2.** Their knowledge of the language used in the scheme or vocabulary   
**6.2.3.** Their interest or knowledge of a particular subject or topical area covered by the scheme or vocabulary  
**6.2.4.** The time they have available for such tasks   
**6.3**. Submissions unclaimed after one week will be assigned to a DC-UB member by the chair.   
**6.4.** The DC-UB chair will not shepherd individual submissions, but will keep track of submissions and ensure that all are resolved in some manner.  
**6.5.** The shepherd will be responsible for verifying the submitted information:   

**6.5.1.** Name of the scheme or vocabulary   
**6.5.2.** Availability and maintenance status  
**6.5.3.** Appropriateness of the maintenance agency  
**6.5.4.** Uniqueness and appropriateness of the proposed token  
**6.5.5.** Possible use with elements not specified in the proposal   
**6.6.** If necessary, the shepherd will initiate contact with the maintenance agency in the case of questions or concerns about the status of the scheme, the proposed token, or to clarify the submission.   
**6.7.** The shepherd will edit the submission and complete the registration process by submitting the information to the DCMI Web Team.  
**6.8.** The DCMI Web Team will report to the UB list when registration has been completed.   
**6.9.** The DC-UB chair will prepare a monthly report of all new schemes.

<ul>
<b>7.1.</b> Submitting Entities: Application profiles may be presented to 
  the Usage Board by any DCMI working group.<br><b>7.2. </b>For the purposes of 
  review by the Usage Board:<br>
  <ul>
<b>7.2.1.</b> Application profiles must provide, for each term, an 
    identifier of the element set where it is defined, ideally in the form of 
    URIs for individual terms.<br><b>7.2.2.</b> If the terms in an application 
    profile describe anything other than generic "resources" (the typical domain 
    of Dublin Core), the application profile must make this clear. This is 
    particularly important if an application profile is based on a data model 
    that describes multiple classes of resources, such as agents or 
    collections.<br><b>7.2.3. </b>It is recommended that application profiles be 
    prepared using previously reviewed application profiles as models for their 
    layout, appearance, and content. Aside from the required term and element 
    set identifiers, there are no particular constraints on the types of 
    documentation -- local definitions, comments, constraints, or technical 
    notes -- that may be associated with a term.<br><b>7.2.4. </b>Each 
    application profile must provide, or point to, a short text that 
    describes:<br>
    <ul>
<b>7.2.4.1.</b> The context and purposes in which the application 
      profile is used or is likely to be used.<br><b>7.2.4.2.</b> The 
      organizations or individuals involved in its development and a capsule 
      history thereof.<br><b>7.2.4.3.</b> Any arrangements, policies, or 
      intentions regarding the future development and maintenance of the 
      application profile.<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>7.3. </b>Review of Application Profiles 
  by the Usage Board<br>
  <ul>
<b>7.3.1.</b> The Usage Board is interested in reviewing application 
    profiles that make substantial use of Dublin Core elements. The review of 
    application profiles by the Usage Board serves to: 
    <ul>
<b>7.3.1.1.</b> analyze the usage of Dublin Core within significant 
      implementations;<br><b>7.3.1.2.</b> assign a DCMI stamp of 
      approval;<br><b>7.3.1.3.</b> promote the sharing of application profiles 
      between communities; and<br><b>7.3.1.4.</b> identify new terms as 
      candidates for inclusion in DCMI namespaces.<br>
</ul>
<b>7.3.2.</b> An 
    application profile is "well-formed" if it is presented in accordance with 
    the broad and flexible requirements outlined above. These presentation 
    requirements may become more specific as "good practice" emerges over 
    time.<br><b>7.3.3.</b> Usage Board review focuses on the use of terms 
    related to Dublin Core terms and on any data models that provide a context 
    for those terms. The Usage Board is agnostic about the use of terms not 
    directly related to Dublin Core; strictly speaking such terms are outside 
    the scope of Usage Board review.<br><b>7.3.4.</b> The use of terms related 
    to Dublin Core (such as refinements of Dublin Core elements, or Dublin Core 
    elements that have been constrained for particular contexts) will be 
    evaluated from the standpoint of grammatical principle (eg, "dumb-down"), 
    clarity, and good practice. <br>
</ul>
<b>7.4.</b> Publication and use of Usage 
  Board Reviews<br>
  <ul>
<b>7.4.1.</b> For application profiles that "pass" review, the Usage 
    Board will publish a Review on a Web page for application 
    profiles.<br><b>7.4.2.</b> Each Review will include, at a minimum:<br>
    <ul>
<b>7.4.2.1.</b> Any comments from the Usage Board on the application 
      profile.<br><b>7.4.2.2.</b> Pointers to locally archived copies of the 
      application profile as originally submitted and (if necessary) as 
      subsequently amended in light of Usage Board comments.<br><b>7.4.2.3.</b> 
      A pointer to the "latest version" of an application profile held by its 
      maintainers.<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>7.5.</b> Review represents a form of recognition, 
  and its URL will be persistent for purposes of 
citation.</ul></font>
