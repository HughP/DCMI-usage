1. Usage Board Membership 
  - 1.1. The UB will consist of nine people appointed by the DCMI Advisory Board (Advisory Board members can serve on the Usage Board, but should not constitute more than half the UB). <font color="Red">[Not sure how it would
          work to have the Advisory Board make appointments.
          --TB]</font>
  - 1.2. Usage Board member terms shall be for two years, renewable once. <font color="Red">[Is this a standard? We
          may want to relax this a bit in order to stagger
          terms--TB]</font>
  - 1.3. Members should be selected based on the following criteria:
  - 
    - 1.3.1. Possession of an understanding of the development history and purpose of the DC element set and its relationship to the metadata world at large
    - 1.3.2. Related to a metadata community relevant to DCMI
    - 1.3.3. Willing and able to commit time and energy to the functions of the UB
    - 1.3.4. Able to communicate verbally and in writing in English sufficient to prepare documents and discuss complex issues in a group setting
    - 1.3.5. Geographic distribution of members is relevant but will not override other criteria
  - 1.4. The UB Chair will be appointed from one of the membership by the DCMI Advisory Board. The term of the chair shall be for two years, renewable once.

  - 2.1. Scheduling
  -

  - 2.2. Funding for meetings
  - 
    - 2.2.1. Funding for meetings should be supported as much as possible by DCMI
    - 2.2.2. Funding for UB meetings held in conjunction with "regular" DCMI meetings or conferences may be supported by the member's institution (if that institution were already funding attendance at the conference/workshop)
  - 2.3. Attendance by members
  - 
    - 2.3.1. Members must attend at least one meeting in a given year to maintain membership in good standing

  - 
    - 2.4.1. Attendance at UB meetings is open to all. <font color="Red">[That means anyone from anywhere
              who wants to go (and incur any travel expenses)? How
              will it be announced? --RG]</font>
    - 2.4.2. Participation in discussion of proposals is encouraged
  - 2.5. Agenda preparation and distribution
  - 
    - 2.5.1. The UB chair is responsible for preparing the meeting agendas and assigning shepherds

  - 3.3. Proposals should include: <font color="Red">[What parts of this need to be included in
          the Registry? --TB] [We also need words here to specify

          into other languages. --TB]</font>
  - 
    - 3.3.1. A "name" <font color="Green"><i>of the

5. Process for moving proposals
6. 
  - 4.1. Announcements
  - 
    - 4.1.1. Announcements of proposals to be discussed by the UB shall be made on the DC-General list and other relevant lists
    - 4.1.2. Announcements of proposals may be made by the WG chair or the UB chair
    - 4.1.3. Announcements should be made at least once, preferably twice
  - 4.2. Shepherds
  - 
    - 4.2.1. Each proposal shall be assigned a shepherd by the UB chair
    - 4.2.2. Shepherds should have knowledge of the proposal issues or be connected to the WG originating the proposal
    - 4.2.3. Responsibilities
    - 
      - 4.2.3.1. Monitor discussion on relevant lists (shepherds should be members of the relevant DC WG list during the time of consideration of a proposal)
      - 4.2.3.2. Summarize the discussion and points of contention of the proposal for the UB, either verbally at the meeting or in writing prior to the meeting (preferred)
      - 4.2.3.3. Serve as liaison to the relevant WG or community during the time the proposal is under discussion and after a decision has been made <font color="Red">[Does this include a
                  "revise and resubmit" recommendation?
                  --TB]</font>
      - 4.2.3.4. Recommend to the UB any further action after a decision has been made on the proposal
  - 4.3. Pre-meeting discussion
  - 
    - 4.3.1. Discussion on proposals should be managed on the relevant DC WG list or the DC-General list (if the proposal does not emanate from a WG) <font color="Red">[Time frame? --RG] [One month?
              --TB]</font>
  - 4.4. Criteria for acceptance of proposals
  - 
    - 4.4.1. Follows existing principles of qualification
    - 4.4.2. Is well-formed
    - 4.4.3. Does not conflict with or create ambiguity with regard to existing elements, or qualifiers
    - 4.4.4. Does not needlessly create problems for existing legacy implementations <font color="Red">["Needlessly" is vague and undefined
              --RG]</font>
    - <font color="Green"><i>4.4.5. Qualifies as an
              interoperability solution with cross-domain
              application</i></font>
  - 4.5. Categories of acceptance (using Tom's definitions)
  - 
    - 4.5.1. CONFORMING. Proposed terms judged by the Usage Committee to substantially meet grammatical principles. <font color="Red">[Use of "terms"
              unclear. Do we mean qualifiers or elements?
              --RG]</font>
    - 4.5.2. NON-CONFORMING. Proposed terms found not to be in conformance with principles, if the Usage Committee wishes to state this for the record. Perhaps the registry would model this as an assertion about a term located in a non-DCMI namespace. In most cases, however, a verdict would simply be returned to the proposer with comments or a recommendation to revise and resubmit.
    - 4.5.3. RECOMMENDED. Conforming terms shown to be of general use and broad interest across disciplines. The Usage Committee may want to recommend that multiple Conforming terms of similar scope be combined into one single Recommended term. <font color="Red">[What about conforming (to principles)
              but not recommended (i.e. not of general use)?
              --RB]</font>
    - 4.5.4. OBSOLETE. For terms that have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete. Such terms will remain in the registry for use in interpreting legacy metadata.
  - 4.6. Voting
  - 
    - 4.6.1. Voting shall be limited to scheduled meetings <font color="Red">[Is there any chance of
              approving through an email ballot non-controversial
              qualifiers, e.g. the registration of a new encoding
              scheme? Or doing a conference call? --RG]</font>
    - 4.6.2. Voting shall be limited to UB members present at the meeting and able to participate in the discussion
    - 4.6.3. UB members who cannot be present may present their arguments for or against a proposal in writing prior to a meeting (this shall not constitute a vote)
    - 4.6.4. UB members who cannot be present may explore other options with the chair, such as conference calling, etc. if they cannot be present for an important vote. In all cases, a vote may not be cast by a member who is not present, either actually or virtually, for the relevant discussion <font color="Red">[What if there's a tie? --RG]
              [Perhaps 2/3 majority is too low a threshold?
              --TB]</font>
