> > > 4.2.3.5. Name and contact information for the assigned shepherd
> 
> **4.3. Shepherds**
> 
> > 4.3.1. Each proposal shall be assigned a shepherd by the UB chair from among the UB membership

> > 
> > > 4.3.3.1. Monitor discussion on relevant lists (shepherds should be members of the relevant DC WG list during the time of consideration of a proposal)

> > 5.3.2. Structure of the UB website is similar to a working group page with an issues, forums and resources section. If necessary, an UB internal section can be password protected.   
> > 5.3.2 Historic documents relevant to the UB work, like voting proposals and results from the first DC Qualifier voting will be archived at the same page.   
> > 5.3.3 Results of the UB work which take the form of official DCMI documents (working drafts, proposed recommendations and recommendations) are made available and archived at: http://dublincore.org/documents/ as all the other similar documents. This includes upcoming lists of acknowledged vocabulary and encoding scheme qualifiers.
