Changes (and fixes to errors) from WORD draft circulated 5/29 noted in <font color="green">green</font>.

Changes after DC-UB meetings in Tokyo in <font color="purple">purple</font>.

Reorganized per comments, 11/30/01. Changes in wording resulting from those changes reflected in <font color="blue">blue</font>.

          have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete.
          Such terms will remain in the registry for use in
          interpreting legacy metadata.</font>
- <font color="purple">3.2. REGISTERED. Used for schemes,
      application profiles, and translations for which the DCMI
      provides information but not necessarily specific
