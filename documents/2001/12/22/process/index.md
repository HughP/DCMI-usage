1. <a id="1." name="1.">Usage Board Membership</a> <font size="-2">[<a href="#top">top</a>]</font>

- 1.1. The UB will consist of at least seven and no more than eleven people (nine is ideal) appointed by the DCMI Directorate.
- 1.2. Usage Board member terms shall be for two years, renewable once. Initial appointments will be made so as to stagger terms.

  - 1.3.3. Willing and able to commit time and energy to the functions of the UB;
  - 1.3.4. Able to communicate verbally and in writing in English well enough to prepare documents and discuss complex issues in a group setting;

- 1.4. The UB Chair will be appointed from one of the membership by the DCMI Directorate. The term of the chair shall be for two years, renewable once.
- 1.5. For internal communication the UB uses the closed mailing list dc-usage@jiscmail.ac.uk. The messages are archived and publicly available at [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage.html).

2. <a id="2." name="2.">Meetings</a> <font size="-2">[<a href="#top">top</a>]</font>

  - 2.1.1. Meetings should be at least twice a year. 
    - 2.1.1.1. One meeting should be scheduled during the annual DC general workshop/conference.
    - 2.1.1.2. The second should be scheduled at a different time of the year, preferably close to other conferences, so as to make attendance convenient for as many members as possible.
    - 2.1.1.3. Scheduling should be done far enough in advance so that as many members as possible may be present.
- 2.2. Funding for meetings should be supported as much as possible by DCMI.
- 2.3. Attendance by members 
  - 2.3.1. Members must attend at least one meeting in a given year to maintain membership in good standing.
  - 2.3.2. Members who miss two meetings in succession may be replaced by the DC Directorate.
- 2.4. Attendance by others 
  - 2.4.1. Attendance at UB meetings by other than the UB is by invitation. 
    - 2.4.1.1. Interested attendees should request an invitation via the UB Chair or the Managing Director.
  - 2.4.2. Participation in discussion of proposals by any interested parties is encouraged.
- 2.5. Agenda preparation and distribution 
  - 2.5.1. The UB chair is responsible for preparing the meeting agendas and assigning shepherds to proposals.
  - 2.5.2. Agenda items shall include the name and email address of the UB member responsible for shepherding the proposal through the UB process.
  - 2.5.3. Agendas shall be available on the UB page of the DCMI website.
- 2.6. Minutes 
  - 2.6.1. Minutes of discussion points and decisions shall be drafted based on notes taken by relevant shepherds and the chair.
  - 2.6.2. Minutes shall be available on the DC UB website.
 3. <a id="3." name="3.">Categories of Usage Board Decisions</a><font size="-2">[<a href="#top">top</a>]</font>
- 3.1. Recommended 
  - 3.1.1. CROSS-DOMAIN. Terms of general use and broad interest across domains.
  - 3.1.2. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC. Terms of interest to a limited domain or set of domains.
  - 3.1.3. OBSOLETE. For terms that have been superseded, deprecated, or rendered obsolete. Such terms will remain in the registry for use in interpreting legacy metadata.
- 3.2. Registered
- 
  - 3.2.1. Used for schemes, application profiles, and translations for which the DCMI provides information but not necessarily specific recommendation.

- 4.2. Documentation 
  - 4.2.1. Important documents like UB membership, meeting agendas, meeting minutes, proposals to the UB, voting or decision documents and results (if not part of minutes) and similar are archived as separate documents in an area of the DCMI web site devoted to the UB.
  - 4.2.2. Structure of the UB website is similar to a working group page with an issues, forums and resources section. If necessary, an UB internal section can be password protected.
  - 4.2.3. Historic documents relevant to the UB work, like voting proposals and results from the first DC Qualifier voting will be archived at the same page.
  - 4.2.4. Results of the UB work which take the form of official DCMI documents (working drafts, proposed recommendations and recommendations) are made available and archived at: [http://dublincore.org/documents/](http://dublincore.org/documents/) as all the other similar documents.
  - 4.2.5. The UB page maintains links to all XML/RDF schemas of UB-maintained namespaces held on the DCMI Web site.

- 5.3. Supporting Materials and Processes for New Element and Element Qualifier Proposals: 
  - 5.3.1. For each proposed element and element qualifier, include supporting information required under Part 5.2 of the UB Administrative Processes. Clearly label the discussion of each Sub-Part.
  - 5.3.2. Review Part 5.4. " [Criteria for Evaluation of Proposals](http://128.253.121.110/DC-UB/DC-UBprocess5.html#5.4.)" of the UB Administrative Processes and provide additional supporting materials where appropriate (e.g., if there are "alternative ways of implementing the term" (5.4.3.3.)), include information regarding the alternatives).
  - 5.3.3. Encoding schemes should be registered with DCMI through its online registration system.
- <a id="5.4." name="5.4.">5.4.</a> Criteria for Evaluation of Proposals 
  - 5.4.1. Clarity 
    - 5.4.1.1. Can the term be clearly defined?
    - 5.4.1.2. Can the semantics of the proposed element or element qualifier be expressed precisely, unambiguously, and briefly?
  - 5.4.2. Practicality 
    - 5.4.2.1. Is the term practical?
    - 5.4.2.2. How difficult would it be for people creating metadata to comprehend the semantics of the proposed element or element qualifier and to apply it reasonably in the description of resources?
  - 5.4.3. Placement 
    - 5.4.3.1. Does the term refine an existing element?
    - 5.4.3.2. If the proposed term is an element, can it reasonably be handled as effectively as an element or value qualifier for an existing element?
    - 5.4.3.3. Are there alternative ways of implementing the term? Within the conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set (i.e., element/element qualifiers and value/value qualifiers), are there alternative ways to achieve the ends sought?
  - 5.4.4. Needs 
    - 5.4.4.1. Is there a clear requirement in existing implementations for the term in support of resource discovery?
    - 5.4.4.2. Is there a demonstrated need for the proposed element, element qualifier, or value qualifier?
    - 5.4.4.3. Are there existing implementations or controlled vocabularies, etc., supporting the term?
  - 5.4.5. Fit with other elements/qualifiers 
    - 5.4.5.1. Follows existing principles of qualification
    - 5.4.5.2. Is well-formed
    - 5.4.5.3. Does not conflict with or create ambiguity with regard to existing elements, or qualifiers
    - 5.4.5.4. Does not create problems for existing legacy implementations if those implementations have followed recommended practice
