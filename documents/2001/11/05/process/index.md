  - 3.2.4. Best practice recommendations
  - 3.2.5. Whether the proposed term is an Element, Controlled Vocabulary <font color="Purple">of general
          application</font>, or Element Refinement (typology to be taken from the reference grammar)
  - 3.2.6. For qualifiers: the element being qualified

        Proposals</font>
  - <font color="Purple">3.3.1. Clarity</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.1.1. Can the term be
              clearly defined?</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.1.2. Can the semantics
              of the proposed element or element qualifier be
              expressed precisely, unambiguously, and
              briefly?</font>
  - <font color="Purple">3.3.2. Practicality</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.2.1. Is the term
              practical?</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.2.2. How difficult would
              it be for people creating metadata to comprehend the
              semantics of the proposed element or element
              qualifier and to apply it reasonably in the
              description of resources?</font>
  - <font color="Purple">3.3.3. Placement</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.3.1. Does the term
              refine an existing element?</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.3.2. If the proposed
              term is an element, can it reasonably be handled as
              effectively as an element or value qualifier for an
              existing element?</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.3.3. Are there
              alternative ways of implementing the term? Within the
              conceptual framework of the Dublin Core Element Set
              (i.e., element/element qualifiers and value/value
              qualifiers), are there alternative ways to achieve
              the ends sought?</font>
  - <font color="Purple">3.3.4. Needs</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.4.1. Is there a clear
              requirement in existing implementations for the term
              in support of resource discovery?</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.4.2. Is there a
              demonstrated need for the proposed element, element
              qualifier, or value qualifier?</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.4.3. Are there existing
              implementations or controlled vocabularies, etc.,
              supporting the term?</font>
  - <font color="Purple">3.3.5. Fit with other
            elements/qualifiers</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.5.1. Follows existing
              principles of qualification</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.5.2. Is
              well-formed</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.5.3. Does not conflict
              with or create ambiguity with regard to existing
              elements, or qualifiers</font>
    - <font color="Purple">3.3.5.4. Does not create
              problems for existing legacy implementations if those
              implementations have followed recommended
              practice</font>

  - 3.4. Distribution
  - 
    - 3.4.1. Proposals will be posted on a WG website or the UB website and linked to the UB agenda
