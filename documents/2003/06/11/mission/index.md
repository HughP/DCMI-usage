1. Mission of the DCMI Usage Board

The mission of the Usage Board is to ensure an orderly
evolution of the metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative. The Usage Board evaluates proposals
for new terms (or changes to existing terms) in light of
grammatical principle, semantic clarity, usefulness, and
overlap with existing terms. To proposals that are accepted
it assigns a specific status. The Usage Board also evaluates
constructs that use DCMI terms, such as Application Profiles.
The Usage Committee strives for consensus, justifying its
decisions and interpretations in terms both of principle and
of empirical practice.

2. Publication policy

The Usage Board makes available its proceedings and decisions
in a publicly available space on the DCMI Web site.

3. Process

Usage Board process is described in a separate document,
"Dublin Core Usage Board Administrative Processes" [1].

4. Scope

The Usage Board maintains the terms defined within DCMI
namespaces, as described in the document "Namespace Policy for
the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative" [2], and reviews constructs
that use these terms, such as Application Profiles [3].

5. DCMI metadata grammar

The principles by which the Usage Board evaluates DCMI metadata
terms are described in a separate document, "DCMI Grammatical
Principles" [4].
