----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/75 

  In Annex B, drop the sentence:

        Note that linked data is expressed in statements that have one and only
        one value per statement.

----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/74#issuecomment-500972767

  Add a note to each of the twelve properties in the following pairs:

        isFormatOf/hasFormat
        isPartOf/hasPart
        isRequiredBy/requires
        isVersionOf/hasVersion
        isReferencedBy/references
        isReplacedBy/replaces

  For example, the note for isFormatOf (3.2.28) would read:

        NOTE # to entry: This property is an inverse property of 
        hasFormat (3.2.23).

        EXAMPLE 1 text/xml
        EXAMPLE 2 http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/mvidformat/dvd
        EXAMPLE 3 23 cm

----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/71#issuecomment-496015784

  In the definition of "education level" (3.2.20), change

        class of entity

  to

        class of agents

----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/70#issuecomment-496015199

  Change the definition of "audience", which currently reads:

        class of entity for whom the resource is intended or useful

  to read:

        class of agents for whom the resource is intended or useful

----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/69#issuecomment-496013990

  After the following text from Annex B:

        When schema elements are expressed as linked
        data, it is important to decide which identifiers
        and identifier namespaces are used. The default
        namespace is based on Persistent URLs (PURLs):
        @Prefix dcterms: http://purl.org/dc/terms/.  It
        is possible to use another persistent
        identifier-based namespace like @Prefix
        dctermsfi: http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:dcterms:.
        and resolve the URNs from this namespace to
        respective PURLs from the default namespace. Just
        providing 1:1 mapping would not bring any
        immediate added value, but since a single URN may
        be resolved to multiple URIs, the latter
        namespace could also be resolved (for instance)
        to Finnish descriptions of the terms.

  Add:

        Tables B.1, B.2, and B.3 illustrate how the
        property names can be prefixed for use as
        identifiers or cited as full URIs using the
        default PURL namespace [Table B.1, Table B.2,
        Table B.3].

----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/68#issuecomment-496012980

  After the paragraph:

        This document establishes a vocabulary for
        cross-domain resource description, known as the
        Dublin Core metadata terms (hereafter DCMI
        Metadata Terms). It includes all of the
        properties and classes in the main namespace of
        DCMI metadata terms, http://purl.org/dc/terms/
        (hereafter "the /terms/ namespace"), as published
        in the DCMI Recommendation document "DCMI
        Metadata Terms" of 2012 [DCMI-TERMS].

  Extend the citation and add one sentence:

        ...of 2012 [DCMI-TERMS and Annex A]. As explained
        in Annex B, these properties and classes may be
        identified by URIs for use in linked data [Annex
        B].

----------------------------------------------------------
DECISION https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/67#issuecomment-496011344

  Change the definition of "Standard" from

        basis for comparison; a reference point against
        which other things can be evaluated

  to

        reference point against which other things can be
        evaluated or compared
