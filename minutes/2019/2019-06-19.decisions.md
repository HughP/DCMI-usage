  Juha has proposed that a note be added to each of 
  twelve properties in six pairs of inverse properties.
  I have proposed a wording for vote at

  After a short but illuminating discussion, Juha has

  format as examples.  Please vote at

  Examples for dct:format

  One reviewer pointed out that the examples for
  dct:format are only literals, although Format does not
  have a literal range, and proposed that we use as an 
  example the Wikidata property for RDF/XML syntax --
  https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48940 .  Karen has 
  proposed instead that we use the RDF property for the 
  datatype HTML -- http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML 
  
  If there is a clear preference for one or the other, we 
  could vote.

  "Tables shall be explicitly cited in the document."

  Tom has posted a proposal showing how this could be 
  done, and it has already been up-voted once.  This 
  issue seems easy; we already have three up-votes at

  "Annexes shall be explicitly cited in the document."
