2004-04-26 Monday meeting, Goettingen

1. Comments on the bylaws from the Goettingen meeting, 2004-04-26:

1.1. The current role of OCLC in DCMI should be explained
     somewhere, but not necessarily in the bylaws, as any
     change in this situation would require a change in
     the bylaws.  The bylaws should describe the "ideal"
     situation -- e.g., the role of Host -- and some other
     document should then describe the status of OCLC as Host.

1.2. The bylaws should provide for an Affiliate Board -- a
     committee that can represent the opinion of affiliates
     (especially in conflict situations) and serve as a forum
     for learning from the experience of other affiliates.
     Such an Affiliate Board would be especially important
     if there were more than four affiliates -- the limit for
     affiliate members to the Board of Trustees.

1.3. It should in any case be made clear how the Affiliate
     members of the Board of Trustees are chosen if there are
     more than four Affiliates.

1.4. A justification or explanation for the membership fee
     structure -- categories of member countries -- should be
     in the bylaws, or the bylaws should at any rate point to
     a document where the structure is explained.

1.5. The bylaws should specify that Affiliates have access to
     the DCMI budget.

1.6. Article I, Section B on Affiliates says, a bit ambiguously,
     that "affiliates are established on a contractual basis".
     The bylaws should describe more explicitly how an Affiliate
     joins DCMI; the length of an affiliate's membership commitment;
     and how an affiliate may terminate membership.

2. Proposed letter from DCMI to DINI or DDB

   DCMI should write a letter to DINI or Die Deutsche
   Bibliothek (to be decided) in which it explicitly invites
   DINI or DDB to form a DCMI Affiliate.  The letter should
   describe the benefits of membership in a way that will help
   "sell" the idea of a DCMI Affiliate (e.g., emphasizing
   rights over the use of the DCMI brand in a particular
   region, for example for certification of consultants or
   documentation).  It would also help if that letter could
   make the point that membership fees could in principle
   decrease over time as the overall fee base is broadened.
   The letter should describe a vision -- what role could
   (and must) such an organization play internationally?
   There was some discussion of whether an Affiliate should
   cover Germany or the "German-speaking" region, and the
   letter might address this issue from a DCMI point of view.


Notes from the meeting:

-- DINI has a budget of 35,000 Euros per year, but has 86 members,
   including IBM, SUN, computing centers, and libraries.

-- DFG has reacted more positively than expected.  They seem
   willing to fund two years.  Walch is the BMBF person.  DFG
   would want to know how the organization would continue two
   years later.

-- The DINI members who indicated an "active" interest in DC
   were Koernig, DDB, Pedagogische Hochschule Osterwald, PH
   Schweiz, Zimmermann, SUB, IWI.
