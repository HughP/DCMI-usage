6. Colima Review of Collection Description Application Profile (shepherd: Andrew)

   Pete has indicated that the "Dublin Core Collection
   Description Application Profile" (DCCDAP) [1] can be made
   ready for review at the Colima Usage Board meeting.

   In order to review the profile in Colima, we will need to
   have some sort of contextualizing statement to the effect
   that this version is considered to be a stable result of
   a process -- not something that will likely be subject
   to significant further changes in the immediate future
   ("this is final for now").

   The UB recognizes that the assignment of URIs to still-undeclared
   terms in the profile is a social issue to be resolved
   between DCMI and strategic partners.

   Even if URIs are not assigned to its terms, we can
   undertake a "preliminary review" and publish its results
   in the form of written comments and evaluation (short of
   formally issuing the status of "conforming") .

   Last August [3], the plan was that UB members would
   read and digest the profile ahead of time and prepare small 
   position papers:
       o Overall shepherd                               Andrew
       o Evaluate terms against Abstract Model    Andrew, Andy
       o Check comments                                  Akira
       o Check documentation                               Tom
       o Check community buy-in                         Andrew
       o Check functional requirements                     Tom

   We should agree on a similar division of tasks in the
   August 11 telecon.

   One task of review should be to evaluate documentation.
   This evaluation should then feed back into the DCMI Usage
   Board Process [4] in the form of minimal documentation
   requirements for "new" terms (these were part of the old
   Process document [5]).  See Appendixes A and B below.
   Pete proposes a proposal for the term "PropertyitemFormat"
   as a model for such documentation [6].

   The provisional timetable is:

        2006-08-24 Thu  DCCDAP submitted for review
        2006-09-14 Thu  UB members complete partial reviews
        2006-09-30 Sat  UB meeting in Colima

7. Replicating DCMES in the DCTERMS Namespace  - and -
   Assigning Domains and Ranges to DCMI properties

   In Seattle, the UB also agreed to progress the assignment
   of domains and ranges to DCMI terms [1], starting with
   approval of the class semantics (buy-in, public comment, F2F
   UB meeting, community consensus) and approval of the use of
   these classes as domains and ranges for DCMI terms (buy-in,
   public comment, F2F UB meeting, community consensus).

   Since then, I have discussed this with Mikael, who sees the 
   following dependencies between the UB effort and the DCAM
   effort:
   
       1. DCAM updates (clarification of Value Type, VES, SES, introduce
          notions of domains and ranges)
       2. DC-TEXT, DC-XML and DC-RDF updated to reflect the above
       3. Copy contents of "1.1" namespace to "terms" namespace
       4. Introduce domains and ranges into "terms" namespace
        - Define semantics
        - Check if we want to reuse W3C classes
        - Declare classes
        - Apply to "terms" properties
       5. Clarify whether encoding schemes are VESs or SESs
       6. Approve DC-TEXT, DC-XML and DC-RDF as DCMI Recommendations

   Mikael has in the meantime kicked off discussion of a 
   proposal on dc-architecture [2].

8. Back burner

   Proposed changes to terms in the /TERMS/ namespace are
   documented at [1] and were discussed in Seattle [2].
   We should make progress on this if possible, but with less
   urgency than the above.
