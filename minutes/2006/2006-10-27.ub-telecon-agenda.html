AGENDA - Usage Board telecon 
2006-10-27 Friday - 1300 UTC, 1500 Berlin, 0600 Seattle, 2200 Tokyo

Participants: Akira, Andrew, Andy, Diane, Joe, Stuart, Tom (chair)
Regrets: Stuart
Guest: Pete

1. Definition of dc:type

   The current definition of dc:type [1] is:
   
       The nature or genre of the content of the resource.
   
   The definition proposed for public comment [2] is:
   
       The genre, functional category, or aggregation level of
       the resource.

   Pete has raised some basic questions regarding the use of
   dc:type in the DCAM (see summary below).

   Resolution of this issue is on the critical path to
   finalizing the DCMES changes.  We have scheduled a telecon
   about this for next Friday, but I hope we can already
   largely work this out on the list.  I have summarized the
   discussion below.

   For discussion: Could we simply revert to the original
   definition (minus "the content of"):

       The nature or genre of the resource.

Summary of discussion

In the draft Domains and Ranges Vocabulary [3], Andy suggests a
range for Type of ResourceType, defined as:

    A genre, functional category, or aggregation level.

Pete has raised some issues with regard to the proposed
definition [4 and below], specifically:

-- DCAM says that "Each resource may be a member of one or
   more classes"; this is a key aspect of the DC resource model.

-- In the current DC-RDF draft [5], statements using dc:type
   are mapped to RDF triples using rdf:type.   The earlier
   DCQ-RDF draft [6] describes rdf:type as a subproperty
   of dc:type, clearly indicating the intent to include the
   instance-class relationship.

-- The word "nature" in the original definition captured this
   intended is-instance-of relation -- implementers see the 
   "world" according to the classes of resources to be described.

-- The proposed definition actually narrows the semantics
   of dc:type (red flag: DCMI Namespace Policy) and does not
   adequately reflect real world use of the dc:type property.

Pete recommends that the proposed definition _not_ be
accepted.  Rather, the definition should make clear that the
instance-class relationship _is_ intended -- "has genre",
"has functional category" and "has aggregation-level" are
just three specific examples of such relationships.

He feels that if we go with the proposed definition,
instance-class relationships would not be representable using
dc:type, so the DCAM would either need to be extended with
something an additional construct (ResourceClassURI?) --
or a property other than dc:type would need to be used.

&gt; 2.2. Type      
&gt; 
&gt;      The definition of Type as "The nature or genre of
&gt;      the content of the resource" was found to be
&gt;      unhelpfully vague.  As with Format, words from the 
&gt;      original comment were used to formulate the definition:
&gt;      "The genre, functional category, or aggregation level 
&gt;      of the resource.
&gt; 
&gt;      The Usage Board will be particularly interested
&gt;      to hear of implementations of Type that do not fit
&gt;      into the scope of "genres, functional categories,
&gt;      or aggregation levels".

&gt;     OLD&gt; Label:          Resource Type
&gt;     OLD&gt; Definition:     The nature or genre of the content of the resource.
&gt;     OLD&gt; Comment:        Type includes terms describing general categories,
&gt;     OLD&gt;                 functions, genres, or aggregation levels for
&gt;     OLD&gt;                 content. Recommended best practice is to select a
&gt;     OLD&gt;                 value from a controlled vocabulary (for example,
&gt;     OLD&gt;                 the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMITYPE]). To describe
&gt;     OLD&gt;                 the physical or digital manifestation of the
&gt;     OLD&gt;                 resource, use the Format element.

&gt;     NEW&gt; Comment:        Recommended best practice is to use a controlled
&gt;     NEW&gt;                 vocabulary such as the the DCMI Type Vocabulary
&gt;     NEW&gt;                 [DCMITYPE]). To describe the file format, physical
&gt;     NEW&gt;                 medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the
&gt;     NEW&gt;                 Format element.
&gt; 
&gt;     Changes proposed:
&gt;     -- In label, changed "Resource Type" to "Type" [see Section 1.6]
&gt;     -- In definition, replaces "content of the resource" with "resource" 
&gt;        [see Section 1.1]
&gt;     -- In comment, replaces "use a value from an encoding scheme" with "use an 
&gt;        encoding scheme" [see Section 1.3]
&gt;     -- In comment, replaces the phrase "use a value from a controlled 
&gt;        vocabulary" with "use a controlled vocabulary" [see Section 1.4]
&gt;     -- Definition reworded for concreteness [see Section 2.2]

From: Pete's posting of October 4, <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0610&L=dc-usage&P=53">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0610&L=dc-usage&P=53</a>

&gt; However the DCMI Abstract Model notes that
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Each resource may be a member of one or more classes.
&gt; 
&gt; i.e. the is-instance-of relation is a core part of the DC resource 
&gt; model. And further
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In DCMI metadata descriptions, the class of the resource being 
&gt; &gt; described is normally indicated by the value of the DC Type property
&gt; 
&gt; In the current DC-RDF draft, statements made using the dc:type property 
&gt; are mapped to RDF triples using an rdf:type predicate. Admittedly it 
&gt; does not say that all rdf:type predicates should be mapped to statements 
&gt; using the dc:type property but if that is not the case then the mapping 
&gt; is one-way (though I suspect it is already for other reasons).
&gt; 
&gt; I note also that the earlier DCQ-RDF draft describes rdf:type as a 
&gt; subproperty of dc:type, clearly indicating the intent that the dc:type 
&gt; property did include the instance-class relationship.
&gt; 
&gt; The inclusion of "nature" in the original definition is important. The 
&gt; is-instance-of relation is a core part of the DC resource model. 
&gt; Metadata implementers work on the basis of domain model in which they 
&gt; partition the resources in their "world" according to their "nature" 
&gt; (e.g. they decide to model their application domain as a set of 
&gt; Documents, Concepts and Agents, etc with specific types of relationship 
&gt; between instances of those classes). How they decide what classes they 
&gt; require is an application-specific consideration, determined by their 
&gt; functional requirements. If it is useful for them to have a class of 
&gt; Blue Things, then they can, and according to the DCAM, the dc:type 
&gt; property is used to represent the instance-class relationship.
&gt; 
&gt; I am concerned that the proposal represents a narrowing of the dc:type 
&gt; property which contradicts an existing DCMI Recommendation and does not 
&gt; adequately reflect real world use of the dc:type property, and I think 
&gt; the revised definition should not be accepted. If anything, as the 
&gt; object of this exercise was "to bring their language into line with that 
&gt; of the DCMI Abstract Model", it should be made clearer in the definition 
&gt; that the dc:type property _is_ - as the DCAM says - used to represent 
&gt; the instance-class relationship, and that "has genre", "has functional 
&gt; category" and "has aggregation-level" are just three specific examples 
&gt; of relationships which are usefully modelled as instance-class 
&gt; relationships
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, if the intent is that dc:type is not usable to represent 
&gt; the instance-class relationship in the general case then this 
&gt; information can not be captured using a property of the DCMES (or the 
&gt; "Simple DC" application profile). I recognise that we are shifting away 
&gt; from the emphasis on the DCMES, but still, this seems a very serious 
&gt; limitation to impose. But if that is what is intended then 
&gt; 
&gt; (a) the statement in the DCAM is wrong
&gt; (b) given that the instance-class is a core part of the resource model 
&gt; (and we are placing emphasis on the importance of application/domain 
&gt; models based on that resource model) then we should indicate how this 
&gt; information is to be captured in DC descriptions
&gt; 
&gt; To do (b), we could either
&gt; 
&gt; - add (yet another) construct to the description model (ResourceClassURI 
&gt; or whatever). I am getting worried that the description model is already 
&gt; becoming too complex, with the separation of VES and valueClass, though 
&gt; I'm also conscious that having a Value Class construct without a 
&gt; ResourceClass may be perceived as odd; or
&gt; 
&gt; - (as at present) specify a property (other than dc:type) to be used in 
&gt; a statement to represent the is-instnce-of relationship

&gt; Proposals
&gt; 
&gt;       * Recommmend the use of rdf:type in RDF metadata, together with an
&gt;         explanation that it is equivalent to dc:type for a DC
&gt;         application.
&gt; 
&gt;       * Revisit this issue after the introduction of domains and ranges
&gt;         of DCMI properties, to make sure the semantics really match.
