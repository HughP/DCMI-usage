dcterms:VocabularyEncodingScheme ‚Ä" APPROVED


ACTION (TOM): change introduction discussing 4646 to Syntax Encoding
Scheme ‚Ä" it currently reads Vocabulary


ACTION (someone?): post a known list of issues to the UB list (1) for
subject ‚Ä" if read as inclusive, the list of examples is incomplete,
(2) classification codes is misleading because it misses classification
captions (use classification expressions instead), (3) ‚Äòspatial‚Äô and
‚Äòtemporal‚Äô are ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù but ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô is too broad ‚Ä" it
allows for topic and this is in conflict with ‚Äòsubject‚Äô [TK] ‚Ä" but
this is an Application Profile issue [TB]


DISCUSSION: because of the problem between ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô on the one
hand and ‚Äòspatial‚Äô and ‚Äòtemporal‚Äô on the other. We have two
problems:

   1.

      overlap between subject and coverage

   2.

      subproperty relations between spatial/temporal and coverage


we have four courses of action:

   1.

      delete assertion spatial/temporal subproperty of coverage [problem
      for legacy and namespace policy]

   2.

      change definition of spatial/temporal to fit coverage [problem for
      namespace policy]

   3.

      do nothing and accept that spatial/temporal are not really
      subproperties

   4.

      introduce a new coverage or recommend spatial/temporal instead


NOTED: 2004 definition of ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô was significantly different
from 2007 ‚Ä" and we may have introduced a problem in the change in 2007
i.e., constraining ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô by using the word ‚Äòtopic‚Äô


NOTED: DCMI might want to build an AP that ameliorates the legacy
problems of 1.1 and TERMS ‚Ä" ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô, ‚Äòidentifier‚Äô,
‚Äòsource‚Äô, etc. ‚Ä" this needs to be linked to discussion and
decision of the AP of Simple DC.


AGREED: ‚Äòspatial‚Äô and ‚Äòtemporal‚Äô subproperty assertions are
inconsistent with the definition of ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô


ACTION (TOM): will put the above discussion on telecon agendas


DISCUSSION: two issues were raised [TK]

   1.

      are all vocabularies defining? ‚Ä" many are just lists, labels, or
      the like, with no formal definitions

   2.

      what is the relationship between concepts and terms in vocabulary
      control?


AGREED: we can use ‚Äòspecified‚Äô instead of ‚Äòdefined‚Äô


Options for fixing #2 above:

          *

            set of concepts specified by‚Ä¶

          *

            vocabulary specified by‚Ä¶


AGREED: change dcterms:LCSH to the set of labeled concepts specified by
Library Congress Subject Headings


[Adjourned for lunch]


Agenda Item #2 ‚Ä" Presentation dcTERMS namespace


Question: How do we want to present DCMES, TERMS, DCAM terms ‚Ä"


#1 ‚Ä" just list these in these sections

1.1

TERMS

VES

SES

DCMITYPE

DCAM


#2 ‚Ä" put TERMS first, to emphasize our preference

put dcterms first

then the 15 1.1 ns -

VES

SES

DCMITYPE

DCAM


AGREED: follow proposal #2 above


ACTION (TOM): add clarification to the introduction ‚Ä" for example
rationale for replicating 1.1 terms in the TERMS ns, recommendations on
what people should be using by preference, and any other ‚Ä" will
circulate to AB for advice on anything else that should be in that
introduction


ACTION (TOM): Prepare restructured TERMS document.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Agenda Item #3: Review of Application Profiles

Usefulness ‚Ä" requirements for the metadata are x,y, or z, and it is
documented as such


There are separate steps for deciding which APs to consider


Criteria should be as clear as possible, and if possible, elicit a yes
or no answer to the question posed. Verbose explanations belong in a
separate document.


Usefulness should only be used in functional requirements relationship
to domain model.


ACTION (TOM): add to the wiki a section called ‚ÄúOrganizational
Context‚Äù to ask evaluation questions about who has stewardship of the
proposed AP

Present: Diane, Stuart, Tom, Andrew, Akira, Joe
Guests: Pete, Mikael, Fredrik, Raju

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Domains and Ranges
 

ISSUE: Should we adopt 'non-literal resource' as a new range value?


Akira: All values will become 'literals'. A date written in the W3CDTF
is a literal but the date itself is *not* a literal. We need more
analysis of what ranges are and what values are appropriate.


Often a range value is just a rewording of a property. Pete says not a
problem.  Issue is whether the relationship between properties and
sub-properties is changed, not how the range restricts values. Choices
about property ranges made for APs affects eventual metadata
interoperability.


Akira: problem with relationship between ranges and properties.
Properties have meanings which are very close to the values of ranges.


NOTE (Tom): 'has domain of rdfs:resource' is an implicit assignment and
there is no need to declare it explicitly.


ACTION (Tom): In cases where the domain is not specified add
'[unspecified]'.


dcterms:contributor -- APPROVED

dcterms:Agent -- AGREED to change comment to read: "Examples of Agent
include person, organization, and software agent." APPROVED
dcterms:AgentClass -- change comment to read: "Examples of Agent Class
include groups seen as classes, such as students, women, charities,
lecturers." APPROVED.
dcterms:coverage -- APPROVED
dcterms:LocationPeriodOrJurisdiction -- AGREED to change 'period' in
definition to 'period of time'. APPROVED.
dcterms:Location -- AGREED to change definition to: "A spatial region or
named place." APPROVED
dcterms:PeriodOfTime -- AGREED to change definition to: "An interval of
time that is named or is specified by its start and end dates." APPROVED.

dcterms:MediaType -- APPROVED
dcterms:PhysicalMedium -- AGREED to change comment to: "Examples include
paper, canvas, or DVD" and to change definition to: "A physical material
or carrier". APPROVED
dcterms:PhysicalResource -- APPROVED
dcterms:FileFormat -- APPROVED
dcterms:DigitalResource -- REMOVE because not used in any Domain or
Range assignment. It was only proposed for reasons of symmetry with
PhysicalResource.
dcterms:SizeOrDuration -- AGREED The definition is to be redone.

ACTION (Pete): To propose new definition for the proposed class
SizeOrDuration.

dcterms:Duration -- REMOVE because not used in any Domain or Range
assignment. It may make sesne to create such a subclass of
SizeOrDuration at a future date but there may be better ways to subclass
SizeOrDuration.
dcterms:Size -- REMOVE because not used in any Domain or Range
assignment. It may make sense to create such a subclass of
SizeOrDuration at a future date but there may be better ways to subclass
SizeOrDuration.
dcterms:identifier -- APPROVED
dcterms:language -- APPROVED
dcterms:LinguisticSystem -- APPROVED
dcterms:publisher -- APPROVED
dcterms:relation -- APPROVED
ISSUE: Whether we leave the range unspecified, or whether we specify a
range of 'non-literal'. This would require the definition of a new class
of 'non-literal'.

ACTION (Tom): Add a note to the terms documentation for each term that
has an approved range of rdfs:resource, except for 'description' and its
sub-properties 'abstract' and 'tableOfContents', to the effect that the
intention is that these terms are to be used with non-literal values,
with a pointer to the AM. The Usage Board is currently investigating a
model for expressing this intention formally.

ACTION (Tom): Add a note to the documentation for 'title' saying the
intention is that while the Usage Board recognises that title is used in
practice primarily with literal values we also recognise that important
uses of 'title' with non-literal values and so the Usage Board is
investigating the options for expressing this.

ACTION (Pete & Mikael): To investigate the usefulness of defining a
class of 'non-literal' and assess what the consequences of this would be
for machine processability.

ACTION: To track the issues involved in the notion of a range of
'non-literal'.
dcterms:rights -- APPROVED
dcterms:RightsStatement -- AGREED to change 'Resource' to 'resource' in
definition. APPROVED
dcterms:LicenseDocument --  AGREED to change 'Resource' to 'resource' in
definition. APPROVED
dcterms:source -- APPROVED
dcterms:subject -- APPROVED
dcterms:title -- NOT APPROVED. Vote -- Yes: 3; No: 1; Abstain: 2. As a
consequence the range for 'title' remains unspecified.
NOTE: For "parallel properties", DCMI could provide pointers to a
"parallel property" in another namespace from a DCMI vocabulary declaration.
Options:  1. Leave range unspecified
              2. Assign range of 'non-literal'
              3. Assign range of 'literal' [the proposal]

Agenda Item 8. Application Profile of Simple Dublin Core
Question being addressed is "What do we want to say simple DC is?". This
work needs to be based on what functions we are trying to provide for.
1. To provide an AP that tells implementors how to use the traditional
'15' in a way that conforms to modern understanding of metadata
descriptions based on the DCAM.
2. Scope and purpose based on the mature understanding of the UB,
developed over the last 6 years.
To be explicit about a number of things, to comment, to point out flaws
and do some house cleaning.
Something that looks very much like the DC15; go into spatial and
temporal; provide a pedagological clarification of the 'core'.
The new AP is not intended to solve the general problem of 'resource
description', which is best addressed by communities in Application
Profiles.
How to deal with source and identifier without going beyond the 15?
NB We are not starting from scratch.
Purpose (MN): to serve as a path for implementors of the simple DC to
move towards a more modern implementation of DC metadata terms.
Need to have a relatively conservative interpretation of the OAI-PMH
version of DC.
Need for a second profile - but what is its function and scope?
Describe the legacy and the path to the new - in two profiles but
presented as one package.
Straightforward to create a AP for traditional 'simple DC'. Then...?
A second AP that provides a modern way of implementing what people think
of as 'simple DC' (but called something else).
To reverse engineer traditional use of 'simple' DC.
Reconstruct a new version of what was called 'simple DC' that implements
modern understandings and ameliorates existing flaws in the DC15.
APs or description set profiles?

ACTION (Tom & Mikael): Create a draft AP using the 1.1 namespace and
which models everything as literals. Document the legacy functional
requirements and the organizational context for this AP.

AGREED: Defer, for the time being, work on a second AP until we have a
better understanding of the functional requirements, scope and purpose
of this second AP.

Agenda Item 4. Agents and FOAF
Does FOAF as a vocab meet the needs of the DCMI community? Does DC have
a role to play in providing an institutional context for FOAF.

Dan Brickley proposed using FOAF for Agents Task Group.  Dan did
functional requirements of FOAF ‚Ä" on Agent Task Group wiki.

Independent namespace reuse study

Name
Organization
Website
Email

FOAF is a private namespace ‚Ä" so there are issues there

2 issues with using FOAF:
    1. desire to use FOAF in DCAM-based APs like Eprints
    2. FOAF could expire as a reliable namespace

Dan owns the namespace, but is not interested in submitting it to a
UB-like process.

Best option would be for the Agents TG/Community to decide and forward
an AP to the UB.
MN: need to decouple the FOAF vocab from the AP issue.

ACTION (Andrew, Tom, Dan B): Agents TG to finish the assessment of FOAF
against the functional requirements. Include context describing kinds of
places where FOAF would be useful and where it wouldn't be useful.
Following this assessment, the TG to propose/recommend a course of
action to DCMI Directorate.

Agenda Item 5. Changes to term declarations in RDF (Tom)

ACTION (Tom): To add to the terms changes document, the change to the
type of the terms in the type vocabulary.
Google Docs -- Web word processing, presentations and spreadsheets. </>
