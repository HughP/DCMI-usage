Change the existing comment:

    This term is intended to be used with non-literal
    values as defined in the DCMI Abstract Model.  As of
    December 2007, the DCMI Usage Board is seeking a way
    to express this intention with a formal range
    declaration.

to read:

    This property is intended to be used with non-literal
    values.

Discussion

This formulation drops the notion that the Usage Board is
(still) seeking a way to express this intention with a
formal range declaration while retaining the message that
the property is intended to be used with non-literal
values.

Defining these properties as instances owl:ObjectProperty
would express the same intention more formally and
strictly, though at the cost of more strongly and
explicitly conflicting with actual usage where literal
values are often used.
