Change the existing comment:

    This term is intended to be used with non-literal
    values as defined in the DCMI Abstract Model.  As of
    December 2007, the DCMI Usage Board is seeking a way
    to express this intention with a formal range
    declaration.

to read:

    This property is intended to be used with non-literal
    values.

for the following properties:

    http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasFormat
    http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasPart
    http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasVersion
    http://purl.org/dc/terms/isFormatOf

Discussion

This formulation drops the notion that the Usage Board is
(still) seeking a way to express this intention with a
formal range declaration while retaining the message that
the property is intended to be used with non-literal
values.

Defining these properties as instances owl:ObjectProperty
would express the same intention more formally and
strictly, though at the cost of more strongly and
explicitly conflicting with actual usage where literal
values are often used.

Comment for dct:relation

The comment for dct:relation in DCMIMT currently says:

    Recommended best practice is to identify the related
    resource by means of a string conforming to a formal
    identification system.

The current ISO draft proposes a different definition
(lightly edited here):

    Recommended practice is to identify the related
    resource by means of a URI or a string conforming to
    a formal identification system.
