43. Coining and applying dcam:rangeIncludes

    Issue 32: "Broken ranges? [3] and "Issue 42: Recommended practice, when
    non-literal values are not available" [5] generated some great discussion,
    covering among other things the history of how `rdfs:domain` and
    `rdfs:range` ended up being defined as they currently are.  The issue was
    also discussed in the June 26 telecon.  It looks like we have converged on
    the following approach:

    * Coin `http://purl.org/dc/dcam/rangeIncludes`, e.g., as defined in the
      current ISO draft:

        Class of which a value described by the term may be an instance.

    * Coin `http://purl.org/dc/dcam/domainIncludes`:

        Class of which a resource described by the term may be an instance.

    * Substitute `dcam:rangeIncludes` for `rdfs:range` (and
      `dcam:domainIncludes` for `rdfs:domain`) for all properties _except for_
      properties with a range of `rdfs:Literal` (which will continued to use
      `rdfs:range`).

    Note that the definition of `dcam:rangeIncludes` proposed here is only
    slightly different from that of `rdfs:range` ("class of which a valued
    described by the term _is_ an instance").  For comparison, see the
    Schema.org definitions [1,2].

    Note that the definitions of rangeIncludes and domainIncludes would be
    included in ISO 15836, but as part of Section 3.1 ("Terms and
    definitions"), where they would be defined in words only (i.e., no URI),
    and not in Section 3.3 ("DCMI properties"), which lists properties of the
    /terms/ namespace with their URIs.

    I have created a new issue (https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/43) in 
    which I split the problem into several aspects:

    * changing rdfs:range into rangeIncludes for properties that use non-literal values
    * not changing rdfs:range rdfs:Literal
    * definition of rangeIncludes based on current DCMIMT and ISO draft
    * definition of rangeIncludes based on Schema.org
    * definition of range used in current DCMIMT and ISO draft

----------------------------------------------------------------------
22. Comment and examples for dct:language - the ISO draft currently says:

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to use either a non-literal value
    representing a language from a controlled vocabulary such as ISO 639-2 or ISO
    639-3, or a literal value consisting of an IETF Best Current Practice
    47 [BCP 47] language tag.

    EXAMPLES  http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng
		(English language in the Library of Congress vocabulary of ISO 639-2 languages)
	      http://iso639-3.sil.org/code/eng
		(English language in the SIL International vocabulary of ISO 639-3 languages)
	      en-US (BCP 47 tag for American English)
	      zh-Hant-HK (BCP 47 tag for Hong Kong Chinese in Traditional script)
	      http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb119308987 (English language in Rameau)

    VOTE: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/22#issuecomment-406253315

----------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Literal example for dct:coverage

    We appear to agree that Coverage is too broadly defined and 
    that the usage comment should encourage use of the existing more 
    specific properties.  Tom has proposed:

        Because Coverage, for historical reasons, was so broadly defined, it is
        preferable, where possible, to use the more specific properties
        Temporal Coverage and Spatial Coverage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. Comments for dct:creator

    The current ISO draft has the following comment for dct:creator:

        Recommended practice is to refer to the creator with an URI.  If no
        such URI is available, it is acceptable to refer to the creator with a
        literal, such as a name or label of the creator which indicates the
        entity. Literals for personal names should be listed surname or family
        name first, followed by forename or given name. When in doubt, give the
        name as it appears, and do not invert.

    Joachim suggests we first resolve issue 42 (about recommended practice 
    when non-literal values are not available).

    SEE: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/25#issuecomment-406359726

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Literal comments for dct:format

    The current ISO draft reads:

	Note 1 to entry: Examples of dimensions include size and duration.
	
	Note 2 to entry: Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary
	such as the list of Internet Media Types [MIME].

	EXAMPLES text/xml
		 4 kB
		 40 x 512 pixels
		 22 in.

    Please note @rguenther52 comment that the PREMIS ontology is removing the
    assertion that premis:hasMedium is a subproperty of dcterms:medium. See:
    https://github.com/PREMIS-OWL-Revision-Team/revise-premis-owl/issues/60 

    SEE: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/26#issuecomment-406362768

----------------------------------------------------------------------
28. Definition of dct:related

    There are actually two proposals here:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
28a. Change definition from:

        A related resource.

    to:

        A reference to a related resource.

VOTE on change of definition: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/28#issuecomment-406366787

----------------------------------------------------------------------
28b. Change comment for dct:relation from:

        Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means
        of a string conforming to a formal identification system.

    to:

        Recommended practice is to identify the related resource by means of a
        URI or a string conforming to a formal identification system.

VOTE on usage comment: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/28#issuecomment-406493908

----------------------------------------------------------------------
29. Pointer to User Guide in dct:relation

    The ISO draft adds:

        Note 2 to entry: Dublin Core Usage guide contains more information
        about various relations and how they should be encoded.

    As of August 23, there are three votes to reject this (e.g., it 
    is not the role of a particular usage comment to reference the 
    user guide).

    VOTE: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/29#issuecomment-406318810

----------------------------------------------------------------------
30. Literal value for dct:rights

    The latest iteration of the ISO draft adds a second comment for 
    dct:rights which, when slightly edited to match the DCMIMT style, 
    reads:

        Note 2 to entry: Recommended practice is to refer to a rights
        statement with a URI.  If this is not possible or feasible,
        a short textual description of rights may be provided.

    VOTE: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/30#issuecomment-406321858

----------------------------------------------------------------------
31. Comment for dct:rightsHolder

    There are several proposed wordings in this thread, so I cannot with
    confidence make a counter-proposal.  I suggest we take the (slightly
    edited) text of the current ISO draft as a starting point:

        Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to refer to the rights holder
        with a name or URI.

    Note: 
    * in other issues, we have rejected the notion that a literal and a URI be
      used in a single value
    * Juha, Karen, and Osma seem to be saying that if the value is a literal,
      it should not be limited to the name of the rights holder because RFC
      3986 covers things like email addresses and telephone numbers.

    @aisaac Would you like to make a new proposal?

42. What should metadata creators do when a property has a non-literal range and
    they have only literals?  

    In July, I thought a rough consensus had emerged:
    
    * We recommend URIs as the first option and provide examples.  
    * In general, we allow (though not encourage) the use
      of literal values.  
    * In the ISO standard, where needed, we provide usage recommendations,
      especially to address common problems (e.g., "CC-BY" for Rights, "French"
      for Language).  
    * In the non-normative Annex B to ISO 15836-2, page 27, we add a paragraph
      or two briefly outlining the options for using literals with properties
      with non-literal ranges -- directly as the object, with blank nodes, with
      hash URIs -- and characterize the advantages and disadvantages of each
      approach.  
    * In our message to the world about the outcome of this whole batch of
      ISO-related decisions, we acknowledge, in addition to the above, that it
      would not actually be incorrect to use `/elements/1.1/` properties but
      that using just one namespace keeps down the complexity of the data model
      and of queries.

    However, there has been alot of discussion since then.
