----------------------------------------------------------------------
42. Comments for dct:creator (depends on 42)

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to refer to the creator
    with a URI. If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value that
    identifies the creator may be provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Literal comments for dct:format

    The current ISO draft reads:

	Note 1 to entry: Examples of dimensions include size and duration.
	
	Note 2 to entry: Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary
	such as the list of Internet Media Types [MIME].

	EXAMPLES text/xml
		 4 kB
		 40 x 512 pixels
		 22 in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
45. Comment for dct:subject

    Recommended practice is to refer to the subject with a URI. 
    If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value that
    identifies the subject may be provided. Both preferably
    should refer to a subject in a controlled vocabulary.

Coining and applying dcam:rangeIncludes/domainIncludes

    1. That we change rdfs:range/domain into dcam:domain/rangeIncludes (or 
       similar) for properties that use non-literal values.

    2. That we not change 'rdfs:range rdfs:Literal'.

    3. That we call the properties domainIncludes/rangeIncludes.
       Counter-proposal (Karen): 
       https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1808&L=dc-usage&P=3265

    4. Possible definitions for domainIncludes (or whatever it is called)

    --  Modeled on definition for rdfs:range
        ("Class of which a valued described by the term _is_ an instance"):

        Class of which a resource described by the term may be an instance.

    --  Following Schema.org:
        
        Relates a property to a class that is (one of) the type(s) the property
        is expected to be used on.
