16. Examples for dct:date

We _almost_ agreed on the September 28 call to approve these.

    EXAMPLES: 2018
	      2016-03-04
	      2017-11-05T08:15:30-05:00
	      1968/2015
	      2006/

    Issue: what should the reference to ISO 8601 point to?

VOTE: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/16#issuecomment-416507394

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. Comments for dct:creator (depends on 42)

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to refer to the creator
    with a URI. If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value that
    identifies the creator may be provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Literal comments for dct:format

    The current ISO draft reads:

	Note 1 to entry: Examples of dimensions include size and duration.
	
	Note 2 to entry: Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary
	such as the list of Internet Media Types [MIME].

	EXAMPLES text/xml
		 4 kB
		 40 x 512 pixels
		 22 in.

See: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/26#issuecomment-406362768

----------------------------------------------------------------------
45. Comment for dct:subject

    Recommended practice is to refer to the subject with a URI. 
    If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value that
    identifies the subject may be provided. Both preferably
    should refer to a subject in a controlled vocabulary.

See https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/45#issuecomment-419414989

----------------------------------------------------------------------
43. Coining and applying dcam:rangeIncludes/domainIncludes

    1. That we change rdfs:range/domain into dcam:domain/rangeIncludes (or 
       similar) for properties that use non-literal values.

    2. That we not change 'rdfs:range rdfs:Literal'.

    3. That we call the properties domainIncludes/rangeIncludes.
       Counter-proposal (Karen): 
       https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1808&L=dc-usage&P=3265

    4. Possible definitions for domainIncludes (or whatever it is called)

    --  Modeled on definition for rdfs:range
        ("Class of which a valued described by the term _is_ an instance"):

        Class of which a resource described by the term may be an instance.

    --  Following Schema.org:
        
        Relates a property to a class that is (one of) the type(s) the property
        is expected to be used on.

See https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/43

----------------------------------------------------------------------
42. Recommended practice when non-literal values are not available

    1. We recommend URIs as the first option and provide examples.

    2. In general, we allow (though not encourage) the use of literal values.

    3. In the ISO standard, where needed, we provide usage recommendations for
       literals, especially to avoid common problems (e.g., "CC-BY" for Rights,
       "French" for Language).

    4. In the non-normative Annex B, "Dublin Core metadata as linked data",
       page 27, we add a paragraph or two briefly outlining the options for
       using literals with properties with non-literal ranges -- directly as
       the object, with blank nodes, with hash URIs -- and characterize the
       advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

    5. In our message to the world about the outcome of this whole batch of
       ISO-related decisions, we acknowledge, in addition to the above, that it
       would not actually be incorrect to use /elements/1.1/ properties, DCMI
       recommends consistent use of /terms/ properties for all uses.
