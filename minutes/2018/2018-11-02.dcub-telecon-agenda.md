Issue 47: "Refines" or "Subproperty of"?
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/47

Discussion to date suggests that the consistent use of RDF terminology
in the ISO standard (eg, "subproperty of") would be preferable to using 
vaguer, legacy, or DCMI-specific terminology (eg, "refines").  It was 
felt that this could be addressed by specifically saying that while DCMI 
Metadata Terms is an RDF vocabulary, it can be used in non-RDF contexts.

Tom proposes:

    That ISO 15836-2 and DCMI Metadata Terms consistently use RDF
    terminology ("property" instead of "element", "subproperty of"
    instead of "refines").

    To replace the third paragraph on page 6 of the latest draft
    (see link above) with the following text:

        This set of properties and classes is expressed as an RDF
        vocabulary and may be used for Linked Data.  Each property
        and class is identified with a global identifier for use
        in RDF data.  Creators of non-RDF metadata can use the
        vocabulary in non-RDF contexts, such as XML and UML, by
        disregarding both the global identifier and the formal
        implications of the RDF-specific aspects of term
        definitions.  Such users can take domain, range,
        subproperty, and subclass relations as usage suggestions
        and focus on the natural-language text of definitions,
        usage notes, and examples.

    In addition, on page 5, amend:

        ISO 15836-1 contains the same elements as ISO 15836:2009.

    to read:

        ISO 15836-1 contains the same elements as ISO 15836:2009.
        As of ISO 15836-2, "elements" are referred to as
        "properties".

    Note that the definition of "property" (3.1.7 on page 8) says:
    "This is a synonym of 'element'."  "Element" itself is defined
    in ISO 15836 Part 1.

Issue 49: Use of examples ("such as") in definitions - dct:creator
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/49

Karen's proposed resolution already has six up-votes (AI, SS, SR, TB, KC,
OS) with no down-votes, and Osma's proposed amendment already has four 
up-votes (KC, AI, OS, TB).

See: 
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/49#issuecomment-430313969
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/49#issuecomment-431808154

Note that we still have not decided whether we agree that 
"person, organization, or service" should be dropped from the 
definition.

Issue 51: Wording of usage comments for Date and its subproperties
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/51

Tom thinks that the following proposal meets all of the requirements raised in
discussion:

    Recommended practice is to express the date, date/time, or period of time
    according to ...

See (and vote): https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/51#issuecomment-434721746

Issue 57: "Has Domain" versus "Domain Includes"
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/57

The following proposal already has four up-votes (TB, SS, KC, OS):

    Change "Has Domain" to "Domain Includes" for Accrual Method, Accrual
    Periodicity, Accrual Policy, Bibliographic Citation, and Medium.
