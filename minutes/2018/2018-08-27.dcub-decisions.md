Sentence to be added to ISO 15836-2 non-normative Annex B, page 27 

    APPROVED (11 out of 11): 

          Linked Data is expressed in statements with just one value per
          statement; multiple values should be placed in multiple statements.
          (This is a good practice for metadata in general.)

    Then _delete_ from comments for `accrualPolicy` and `accrualMethod`:
    
          DELETE> Where multiple policies apply, a separate
          DELETE> statement should be used for each policy.

    See: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/35#issuecomment-405987320

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to use either a non-literal value
    representing a language from a controlled vocabulary such as ISO 639-2 or ISO
    639-3, or a literal value consisting of an IETF Best Current Practice
    47 [BCP 47] language tag.

              (English language in the Library of Congress vocabulary of ISO 639-2 languages)
	      http://iso639-3.sil.org/code/eng
              (English language in the SIL International vocabulary of ISO 639-3 languages)
	      en-US (BCP 47 tag for American English)
	      zh-Hant-HK (BCP 47 tag for Hong Kong Chinese in Traditional script)
	      http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb119308987 (English language in Rameau)

Literal example for dct:coverage

    APPROVED (7 out of 7): 

        Because Coverage is so broadly defined, it is preferable to use the
        more specific properties (refinements), Temporal Coverage and Spatial
        Coverage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment for dct:rights

    APPROVED (7 out of 7):

        Note 2 to entry: Recommended practice is to refer to a rights statement
        with a URI.  If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value
        (name, label, or short text) may be provided.
