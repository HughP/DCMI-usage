Issue 47: "Refines" or "Subproperty of"?
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/47

That ISO 15836-2 and DCMI Metadata Terms consistently use RDF terminology
("property" instead of "element", "subproperty of" instead of "refines").

Replace the third paragraph on page 6 of the latest draft (see link above) with
the following text:

    This set of properties and classes is expressed as an RDF vocabulary and
    may be used for Linked Data.  Each property and class is identified with a
    global identifier for use in RDF data.  Creators of non-RDF metadata can
    use the vocabulary in non-RDF contexts, such as XML, JSON, UML, and
    relational databases, by disregarding both the global identifier and the
    formal implications of the RDF-specific aspects of term definitions.  Such
    users can take domain, range, subproperty, and subclass relations as usage
    suggestions and focus on the natural-language text of definitions, usage
    notes, and examples.  In addition, on page 5, amend:

ISO 15836-1 contains the same elements as ISO 15836:2009.  to read:

    ISO 15836-1 contains the same elements as ISO 15836:2009.  As of ISO
    15836-2, "elements" are referred to as "properties".
