## DCMI Usage Board - 2018-11-02 - decisions - AMENDED

https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/minutes/2018/2018-11-02.dcub-decisions.md

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace paragraph 3, page 6, with:

    This set of properties and classes is expressed as an RDF vocabulary and
    may be used for Linked Data.  Each property and class is identified with a
    global identifier for use in RDF data.  Creators of non-RDF metadata can
    use the vocabulary in non-RDF contexts, such as XML, JSON, UML, and
    relational databases, by disregarding both the global identifier and the
    formal implications of the RDF-specific aspects of term definitions.  Such
    users can take domain, range, subproperty, and subclass relations as usage
    suggestions and focus on the natural-language text of definitions, usage
    notes, and examples.  
    
On page 5, amend:

    ISO 15836-1 contains the same elements as ISO 15836:2009.  
    
to read:

    ISO 15836-1 contains the same elements as ISO 15836:2009.  As of ISO
    15836-2, "elements" are referred to as "properties".

See: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/47

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Decision re: Issue 47 amended 2018-11-23, correcting a simple error of omission]

ISO 15836-2 should consistently use the following terminology:

    -- "property" instead of "element"
    
    -- "subproperty of" instead of "refines"
