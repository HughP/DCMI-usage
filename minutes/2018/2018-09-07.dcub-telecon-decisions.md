DECISION - Comments for dct:creator

    Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to identify the creator

    identifies the creator may be provided.

DECISION - Literal comments for dct:format

        Note 1 to entry: Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary
        where available. For example, for file formats one could use the list
        of Internet Media Types [MIME].

        Note 2 to entry: Examples of dimensions include size and duration.

DECISION - Comment for dct:subject

    Recommended practice is to refer to the subject with a URI. 
    If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value that
    identifies the subject may be provided. Both preferably
    should refer to a subject in a controlled vocabulary.
