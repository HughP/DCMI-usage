    C. Semantic changes in DCMI terms

    Changes of definitions within DCMI recommendations and/or DCMI term

    DCMI term declaration. If, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, such
    changes of meaning are likely to have substantial impact on either machine

    these changes will be reflected in a change of URI for the DCMI term or
    terms in question. ...
