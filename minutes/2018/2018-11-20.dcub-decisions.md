## DCMI Usage Board - 2018-11-20 decisions

These decisions: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/minutes/2018/2018-11-20.dcub-decisions.md

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Property domains

    Five properties in DCMI Metadata Terms have formal domains (rdfs:domain):
        
        http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation
        http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualMethod
        http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualPeriodicity
        http://purl.org/dc/terms/medium
        http://purl.org/dc/terms/accrualPolicy

    Four of these retain their formal domain - i.e., no change from 
    the current ISO draft ("Domain:").
        
    For one property, Medium, the domain changes to "Domain Includes":

        Domain Includes: Physical Resource

See: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/59

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranges of properties with literal ranges
    
    All properties with range of rdfs:Literal remain unchanged (i.e., 
    they keep "Range:" instead of changing to "Range Includes:").
    
    These are:

    --  Date and its subproperties
