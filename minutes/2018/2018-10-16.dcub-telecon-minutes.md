This week: issues related to ISO 15836-2

* These minutes: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/minutes/2018/2018-10-16.dcub-telecon-minutes.md
* Attended: Tom (chair), Joe, Osma, Antoine, Karen, Joachim, Stefanie

See latest ISO draft (_draft_ DIS) and ISO WG comments:
* https://github.com/dcmi/iso15836-2/blob/master/drafts/ISO_CD_15836-2_2018-10-02.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 47: "Refines" or "Subproperty of"?
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/47

Clarification:
* This is about the use of "Refines:" versus "Subproperty of" as an attribute in a term description.
* This is _not_ about the use of "refines" in the wording of usage comments.
* As an attribute of term descriptions, "Refines:" _always_ means "Subproperty of"
* The issue raised (above) is that "Subproperty of" is defined in the ISO draft (3.1.10), but not used in the document.
  * However, the current ISO draft does not define "Refines:" either (!).
* "Refines:" is defined in DCMI Metadata Terms as: "A Property of which the described term is a Sub-Property."

Possible solutions discussed:
* Drop "Subproperty of" and just use "Refines"
* Drop "Refines" and replace with "Subproperty of"
  * Advantage: "Subproperty" is commonly used, while "Refines" is legacy DCMI jargon.
  * Disadvantage (?): Less applicable to XML.

Either way, since we have used "Refines:" in the past.

ACTION: Continue discussion in Issue 47.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 48: "Element" and "Property"
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/48

Discussion:
* Though "element" and "property" are used interchangeably, they are 
  not quite synonyms.  A note may be needed.

ACTION: Continue discussion in Issue 48.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 49: Use of examples ("such as") in definitions - dct:creator
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/49

Discussion:
* It can make sense to repeat the information ("person, organization, 
  or service" somehow because people do not always look at 
  superproperties.
* This information could be in a note.
* Having examples for dct:creator without saying what they are can 
  be confusing.  Somehow we need to say what we think these things 
  are.  "Hubble telescope"?  "ISI"? - one needs to know what an 
  ISNI is.

ACTION: Karen to annotate the examples as person, organization, or service
(and compare to how other examples are handled.)

ACTION: Continue discussion in Issue 49 to decide whether we agree 
to drop "person, organization, or service" from the definition and 
how to annotate the examples given.

DECISION

Change (as worded in the October 2 ISO draft):

    entity primarily responsible for making the resource

back to 

    entity responsible for making the resource

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 50: Use of examples ("such as") in definitions - dct:issued
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/50

DECISION 

Usage Board agrees on dropping "(e.g. publication)" from the definition.

ISSUE CLOSED.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 51: Wording of usage comments for Date and its subproperties
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/51

Discussion:
* The common meaning of "date" arguably does not include time and period.
* "Time" alone would not be a date; Date plus Time would be.
* Is "Jurassic" a period? "Summer"?
* DCMI comment for "date" says: "may be used to express temporal 
  information at any level of granularity".
* dct:date has a range of rdfs:Literal - the intention is to use 
  the property with parsable strings that express points or 
  ranges of time, not for labels like "Jurassic".
* Perhaps the note could refer to a "date/time format" so that time 
  is not standing on its own.


ACTION: Continue discussion in Issue 51.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 52: Definition of dct:dateCopyrighted
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/52

* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/54

DECISION

    any changes in ownership and custody of the resource since its creation
    that are significant for its authenticity, integrity, and interpretation

Note: 
* applies to the definition of the class Provenance Statment 
* definition of the property Provenance remains the same

ISSUE CLOSED

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 55: Definition of "resource"
* https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/55

DECISION - add to Note 1 to entry

  can simply be added to Note 1.
