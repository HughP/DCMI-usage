#### Property ranges

The focus of discussion will be whether to replace rdfs:range with
rangeIncludes (https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/36).  Please repare by
responding to the straw poll.

As background for the discussion, please review at the entire thread at
https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/32 - a very interesting read!

It would be great if we could reach consensus on the call.  If we can then, 
time permitting, we could walk through the other issues related to range - see
https://github.com/dcmi/usage/labels/ranges.
