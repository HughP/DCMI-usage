Andrew: Potential addition of property to AGLS has prompted
submission.

Proposal is for one property only. Suggested VES will be
owned by AGLS.

Potential issues of overlap with work of other groups (IMS,
W3C).

Need clarity about range of property. Maybe more than one
property required?

Tom: Co-ordinate development of property and VES with AGLS?
Need good definition of property, clear specification of range.

RESOLVED: Co-ordinate development of property and VES with
AGLS. Andrew to shepherd.

Step 1: Liaise with AGLS re co-ordinated publication of
property dcterms:accessibility and AGLS VES.

Step 2: UB to ask AGLS to confirm desired VES.

Step 3: UB and AGLS to jointly agree natural language
definition and formal range to express semantics of
resource-value relationship. (Note: currently apparent
overlap between values for "accessibility" and "accessMode"
properties.)

Goal: Co-ordinated publication of DCMI property and AGLS VES
along with simple usable documentation.
