Usage Board reviews Scholarly Works Application Profile and term proposals

2008-12-08.  At its face-to-face meeting in Berlin [1], the
DCMI Usage Board reviewed the Scholarly Works Application
Profile [2] and found it to be in conformance with its current
review criteria, pending minor revisions.  In response
to a proposal from the DCMI Libraries Community for a new
property "holding location", the Usage Board suggested the use
of the existing property "availability" in the AGLS Metadata
Terms [3] maintained by the National Archives of Australia;
suggestions regarding proposals for properties "date captured"
and "version" were forwarded to the DCMI Libraries Community
for further discussion.  The Usage Board resolved to work
with the AGLS Working Group on finalizing a DCMI property
and related AGLS vocabulary encoding scheme for describing
characteristics related to the accessibility of resources.
