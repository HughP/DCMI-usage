Profile Review Criteria (Tom)

For discussion on the call, everyone please check:

    <a href="/documents/2009/01/05/profile-review-criteria/">http://dublincore.org/documents/2009/01/05/profile-review-criteria/</a>

and review the changes and errata note as described in:

    <a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0902&L=DC-USAGE&P=3975">https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0902&L=DC-USAGE&P=3975</a>

ISSUE 2008-09-21: Criteria should reflect that a property list
constraint should be used once only within a description
template. Guidance should be given to application profile
creators on this issue, e.g. using the subject example where
an application profile wants to require an LCSH term and have
an option to add a free tag or a different vocabulary term.
Consider inclusion of this guidance on the current proposed
guidelines for application profiles.  One option is to make
the constraint human-readable only. Clarify with Mikael before
progressing this.

Review of Scholarly Works Application Profile (SWAP)

For discussion on the call, everyone please read

    <a href="/usage/reviews/2009/swap/">http://dublincore.org/usage/reviews/2009/swap/</a>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
News item on SWAP review

    Tom will propose a text for discussion on the list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Review of DCMI Libraries properties (Stefanie)

Berlin conclusions:

-- Date Captured: Proposal does not provide well-defined notion
   of "captured", but creating a new term dcterms:captured as a
   subproperty of dcterms:created would be possible.

-- Holding Location: suggestion to use existing term
   agls:availability was accepted by Libraries AP Task Force.

-- Version: dcterms:version could be created if revised
   definition were proposed to the Usage Board.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Review of Accessibility properties (Andrew)

Berlin conclusions:

    RESOLVED: Co-ordinate development of property and VES with
    AGLS. Andrew to shepherd.

    Step 1: Liaise with AGLS re co-ordinated publication of
    property dcterms:accessibility and AGLS VES.

    Step 2: UB to ask AGLS to confirm desired VES.

    Step 3: UB and AGLS to jointly agree natural language
    definition and formal range to express semantics of
    resource-valuerelationship. (Note: currently apparent
    overlap between values for "accessibility" and "accessMode"
    properties.)

    Goal: Co-ordinated publication of DCMI property and AGLS VES
    along with simple usable documentation.

Ongoing actions and issues...

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Joe and Andrew to continue work on Coverage.

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom (and Mikael) to continue work on Simple Dublin Core.

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom to amend the naming policy (DCMI
    names should not differ only with respect to case).

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Andrew and Julie to write a one-page guideline on
    creating new terms that comply with the DCAM (replaces the
    original action).

    ACTION 2008-09-21: Tom to correct RDF schemas of DCMI Metadata
    Terms to use blank node with publisher.

    ISSUE 2008-09-21: Is it good practice to provide a
    Value VES in addition to a Value URI, or is it arguably
    redundant?  (Example: "Entity Type" under "Scholarly Work"
    in SWAP, <a href="http://dublincore.org/scholarwiki/SWAPDSP">http://dublincore.org/scholarwiki/SWAPDSP</a>).
    Guidance on this point may belong in the application
    profile guidelines.

    ISSUE 2008-09-21: Rendering of Wiki pages using the DSP
    syntax does not capture all of the DSP detail and uses
    different labelling.  It would be useful to hyperlink
    labels in the DSP rendered page to the DSP documentation
    itself.  Also, to hyperlink description template labels
    within the wiki page itself, e.g. creator to agent
    description.
