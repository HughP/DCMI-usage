======================================================================
Changes in DCMI Metadata Terms

--  Akira noticed that Pete's rationale for changes to the comments 
    for dcterms:contributor, dcterms:creator, and dcterms:publisher,
    which was copied verbatim into the decision document, contained
    a sentence -- "See [1] for an example of this confusion" -- with
    no reference for "[1]".  To compound the confusion, the JISCMAIL URIs
    appear to have changed, so that Pete's original posting is no longer
    where Akira found it [*], but at [**].  Solution: removed sentence
    with the missing reference from [***]
    
    [*] https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0903&L=DC-USAGE&P=982
    [**] https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0903&L=DC-USAGE&P=1111
    [***] http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2010/dcterms-changes/index.shtml

--  As per Akira's suggestion, changed wording in rationale for dcterms:title
    range from

         ".. be be rendered in more than one writing system."

    to the less controversial

         ".. be be rendered in more than one script."

    in http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2010/dcterms-changes/.

--  Corrected references to ISO 15836 [1] and ANSI/NISO Z39.85 [2].
    These were already corrected by hand, with an errata note, in the
    stand-alone DCES document [3], which will now be re-published (without
    the errata note) as [4].

    I have corrected these references in the xsl source used to generate
    the updated DCMI Metadata Terms [5].

    [2] http://www.niso.org/standards/z39-85-2007/
    [3] http://dublincore.org/documents/2008/01/14/dces/
    [4] http://dublincore.org/documents/2010/10/11/dces/
    [5] http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2010/dcterms-changes/

--  Jacco van Ossenbruggen noticed that the non-existent class
    dcterms:Collection was used as a domain for accrualPolicy,
    accrualPeriodicity, and accrualMethod, I have corrected this
    to dcmitype:Collection (http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection)
    in the source file [1], so the changes will show up in [2].
    This change is documented in [3].

--  New Syntax Encoding Scheme for RFC 5646.
    As decided in the June call, created the datatype http://purl.org/dc/terms/RFC5646
    following the precedents of dcterms:RFC1766, dcterms:RFC3066, and dcterms:RFC4646.

--  Added range of dcam:memberOf:

         dcam:memberOf rdfs:range dcam:VocabularyEncodingScheme

--  Asserted the equivalence of dcterms:creator and foaf:maker
    Added to the Decision document:

        RESOLVED: That in agreement with the maintainers of the 
        FOAF vocabulary, which have added to FOAF the assertion

             foaf:maker owl:equivalentProperty dcterms:creator

        DCMI will assert:

             dcterms:creator owl:equivalentProperty foaf:maker 

    The URIs are:
        http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/maker
        http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator

    -- NOTE: Added a new tag <EquivalentProperty> to XML source
       of term description, dcterms-properties.xml.  Will add the
       information both to the Web pages and the RDF schemas by
       hand for now.

    -- The introductory text of DCMI Metadata Terms was
       edited to add "Equivalent Property".

======================================================================
Changes in RDF schemas

--  ** PENDING USAGE BOARD APPROVAL **
    Changed titles of RDF schemas.  Having just drafted a
    glossary entry [1] about DCMI usage of the concept "DCMI
    Namespace", I couldn't help noticing that the titles of
    the RDF schemas use "DCMI Namespace" in a way that is
    arguably wrong...

    --  Changed from:
        DCMI Namespace for metadata terms related to the DCMI Abstract Model
        DCMI Namespace for the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1
        DCMI Namespace for metadata terms in the http://purl.org/dc/terms/ namespace
        DCMI Namespace for metadata terms of the DCMI Type Vocabulary
   
    --  To:
        Metadata terms related to the DCMI Abstract Model
        Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1
        DCMI Metadata Terms in the /terms/ Namespace
        DCMI Type Vocabulary

    [1] https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1009&L=DC-GLOSSARY&P=6753

--  With dcterms:publisher, used "http://purl.org/dc/aboutdcmi#DCMI" 
    instead of the value string "The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative".

--  Corrected an error in generating the RDF representation
    of dcterms:title, the definition of which was presented
    using dcterms:description instead of rdfs:comment, as the
    other properties.
