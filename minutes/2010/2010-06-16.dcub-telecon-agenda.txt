1. Errata and other changes to DCMI Metadata Terms (Akira)
    
    Meeting notes:
    --  http://dublincore.org/usage/minutes/2009/2009-10-16.dcub-meeting-seoul-minutes.html

    Draft decision document:
    --  http://dublincore.org/usage/decisions/2010/dcterms-changes/index.shtml

    Akira's check:
    --  https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1003&L=DC-USAGE&P=7190

    Richard Cyganiak noticed an error (no rdfs:comment for dc:title):
    --  https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1006&L=DC-ARCHITECTURE&P=57

    Related actions:

        ACTION 2009-10-16: Pete to look at XSLT for dcmi-terms page index
        to determine whether "ready reference" links to terms of the DCMI
        Type Vocabulary and terms related to the DCMI Abstract Model might
        be added.
        -- larger issue is whether DCMI Metadata Terms should be published 
           using RDFa -- e.g., see 
           https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1005&L=DC-ARCHITECTURE&P=4348

        ACTION 2009-10-16: Tom to correct RDF schemas of DCMI Metadata Terms
        to use blank node with publisher.

2.  Asserting the equivalence of dcterms:creator and foaf:maker (Tom and Pete)

    In Seoul, our proposal assumed:
         FOAF says
             foaf:maker rdfs:subPropertyOf dcterms:creator .
         DCMI says
             dcterms:creator rdfs:subPropertyOf foaf:maker .

    Since then, FOAF now says:
             foaf:maker owl:equivalentProperty dcterms:creator .

    ACTION 2009-10-16 Pete and Tom: Pete will investigate OWL
    further to see whether it is possible to do this using OWL;
    Pete and Tom will work up a post to email to the DC
    Architecture and the Semantic Web community with cross
    postings pointing to the DC Architecture list email.

    PROPOSED DECISION (to add to Decision document):

        RESOLVED: That in agreement with the maintainers of the 
        FOAF vocabulary, which have added to FOAF the assertion

             foaf:maker owl:equivalentProperty dcterms:creator

        DCMI will assert:

             dcterms:creator owl:equivalentProperty foaf:maker 

3. Response to request for new term?
   
   -- David Bromage points out that RFC 5646 has obsoleted RFC 4646
      https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1006&L=DC-GENERAL&P=52

   Possible responses:

   -- Simply vote on the call and fold this into the latest batch of changes:

      RESOLVED: That DCMI coin the URI
      http://purl.org/dc/terms/RFC5646
      following the precedents of
      http://purl.org/dc/terms/RFC1766
      http://purl.org/dc/terms/RFC3066
      http://purl.org/dc/terms/RFC4646.

   -- Explain that we do not intend to continue following this course.

4. Corrections to "DCAP Guidelines"

6. Future of the Usage Board

   What is the proper role (or mix of roles) for the Usage Board?

   -- Application profile review.
   -- Review of user guidance material (such as FAQ, Glossary, User Guide)
   -- DCMI Metadata Terms maintenance.

   What is the optimal size and skill mix of the Usage Board?
   Should it be one group or two?

7. Next steps
   
   -- DC-2010 in Pittsburgh
   -- Telecons
