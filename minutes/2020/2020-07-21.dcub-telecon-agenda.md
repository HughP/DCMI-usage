1. Introducing Grace Johnson and quick introductions (5 minutes)

2. Mapping of properties - triage and priorities (20m on Tuesday, 50m on Wednesday)

   See: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/mappings/properties.md

3. Mapping of classes (10m on Tuesday)

   See https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/mappings/classes.md and 
   https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/mappings/dcmitype.md

   On Tuesday, discussion of the candidate mappings will be limited to half an hour total so that we have enough time to discuss issues around the review process, scope of mappings, and the like.

4. Issues (25 minutes on Tuesday, 10 minutes on Wednesday)

- Process
  - Github issues with votes for the easy ones?
  - Telecons for mappings that require more discussion?

- Focus of mapping exercise
  - Close matches only, or also broad and narrow matches?
  - Include skos:broadMatch and skos:narrowMatch when available?

- Scope of mapping exercise
  - DCMI Type Vocabulary?
  - Classes in the /terms/ namespace (mostly used for domains and ranges)?

- Choice of mapping predicates for DCMI mappings
  - rdfs:equivalentProperty?
  - skos:closeMatch? skos:exactMatch?

- Choice of mapping predicates for Wikidata mappings
  - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1628 ("equivalent property")?
    - "equivalent property in other ontologies (use in statements on properties, use property URI)"

  - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2888 ("exact match")?
    - "(URLs only) used to link two items, indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably"

- Publication of mappings
  - On dublincore.org
    - RDF representation (N-Triples, XML, Turtle?)
    - Web pages
      - Separate document about mappings?
      - Include in DCMI Metadata Terms?

  - On Wikidata
    - Edit individual WD property pages for extraction via SPARQL query?
      - See https://bit.ly/dcmimt_on_wikidata
    - Static table?
      - See https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Gjohnson1110
      - Would move to https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Dublin_Core
