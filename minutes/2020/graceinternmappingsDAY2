Karen: I thought it might be a good idea to add the definition for the ones that we selected so people don't have to start popping around
Tom: are you generally thinking that we take this document and use it as point of referenct for the mappings?
Karen: should we include things like narrow and broad terms, harder to maintian 
  -also can't assume narrow and broad terms are complete 
Tom: start with contributer
-defined in schema, soemone who makes a secondary contribution
-how it was defined in dcmi ------
-changed to anyone that contributes 
-so technically schema contributor is narrower that dcterms contributor 
Stephanie: yes it is semantically narrower 
Karen: less damaging to go from narrower to broader verses vice versa
stephanie: 
karen: this is the best guess, assuming that you have dc terms contributor, i cant see what else you could go to for schema 
stephanie: im not sure i would call it an equivalent 
karen: we didnt change the EQ and everything so that's still open 
tom: when you say in the document, this is the merging of Graces mappings and the task force mappings 
Karen: the markdown document that we started with, all we did was pick one to be the one to one, we didnt hcange if it said = or narrower 
if we want to make it clsoe match we can, im not sure it really makes a difference 
Joe: under DC terms contributor 0------
Tom: worth spending mroe time on this first one because it will be easier to make these same types of deicisions later on 
- I do agree that schema contributor is the closest thing to dc contributor, but if we think it is narrower we can say narrow match or somethign like that 
- we dont have super property like we do for rdf 
-if the aren't really equivalent we shouldnt mark it as such 
Karen: we are giving people mappings, we might want to explain the -----
antoine: what about trying to do both? we could register the formal subproperty link
-we beleive schema contributor is narrower than dc 
-we can explain the context
stephanie: we could use close match 
karen: my gut feeling is that there arent any perfect matches 
---
phil: the narrower matches are only relevent if mapping from schema to dc 
karen: im assuming that these narrower/broader ect ones will be gone
- i dont think were oging to try to define broader and narrower 
tom: eq means close match and this is as close as we can get and we delete the toehr ones 
karen: what i odnt like abotu equal or exact match is that between different vocabularies these are alwasy in different contexts 
- i think that we could say "use for" i dont think we ever really have an equivalence
antoine: coudl we use the subproperty link? 

use skos use? 

Dc terms coverage: 
Tom: one of most problamatic terms in dc 
-for iso standard we decided to discourage people from using coverage and encourage people to use temporal or spacial coverage 
-unlikely that were going to find EQ 

Stephanie: schema location broader than dc coverage, content location is narrower 

karen: i think schema location is narrower also 

stephanie: no 

Phil: I think they're just different 

karen: coverage is either the location or the time period 

antoine: europeana took dc coverage 

-0--
karen: maybe we shouldn't include coverage 

antoine: the only vague --- would be about, but that would be violating what we have on dc 

decision: not mapping to coverage 

Tom: creator- creator? 
stephanie: schema creator says this is the same as author and we just decided that schema author is more narrow than dc creator 

date

karen: dc terms date is very commonly used so we do have to map from it 

tom: we cant but there is no equivalent 

karen; but we still ahve to map from it, the closest we thought to it were datecreated and datepublished 

antoine: bsed on use cases?

stephanie: when you lo

karen: but if its not bibliographic? 

stephanie: but if data from museums its date created 

phil: direct people to sub properties 

karen: asking people to make decisins they may not be able to make 

phil: we have to ask them to make a decision somehow 

antoine: different way of formulating but wouldnt the end result be the same 

karen: i think it has to do with whether you expect people to udnerstand their own data vs dublin core
antoine: we should just reflect the end result? 

karen: two steps or one step? you have dc terms date --- dc terms date, here are some possibilites, use the one that is closest 
as i recall, the problme is that schema has a lto of dates--do we want to send people hunting around?

stephaine: in relation to all of the pr


karen: this is looking at the 15, when we go beyond this, we will be mapping these other date properties to something in schema 

joe: so should our approach be only confirm the ones that are exact? then come back to ones like these 

antoine: it feels strange to ignore the subproperties when the super property is ambiguous 

karen: based on stats from yeasr ago, by far the dc terms that are used in data are 15 that we use 

tom: let's discuss process,
