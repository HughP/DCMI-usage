DCMI Usage Board - Telecon #67 - Tue - 2020-07-21 - minutes

- These minutes: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/minutes/2020/2020-07-21.dcub-telecon-minutes.md
- Attended: Tom, Stuart, Karen, Grace, Phil, Stefanie, Antoine

__Tom__:
- Explaining the work Grace has done as well as the format of the mappings page

__Karen__: 
- Why are we doing this/what is the purpose?

__Tom__:
- we should try to find terms that could be substituted in various contexts, where you could merge data that is expressed using DCMI terms and data that is expressed using, for example wikidata 

__Antoine__: 
- curious about the context of these mappings
- we had a small task group working on schema to dc mappings a while ago 
- what is the status of these mappings?

__Tom__: 
- we did have a task group several years ago but schema.org evolves very quickly 
- I would like to get some basic mappings that we can publish along with DCMI metadata terms and or publish to our website 
- antoine do you see a problem?

__Antoine__:
- it's not so much a problem of what we want to do but of finding the motivation
- how official is this? Are we hoping to add this to the DC website or is this more of a side project?

__Tom__: 
Actually, that's one of the questions I wanted to ask:
- What do we want to do with these mappings? 
- The reason the previous task group mappings never continued is we couldn't decide a way to present the mappings to the group in an efficient way--we never resolved how we would publish those mappings 
- we now have a more efficient way to make/present the mappings, now being able to simply click on the word to get the definition
- definetly an open question as to how officially we want to do this, how much time we want to put in 
- there are ways to be more efficient
    - only focus on mappings to the 15 elements 
    - only focus on close matches 
    - only mappings to properties not classes 
- is this a useful exercise? Should we try to publish this in an official way? 
- Should we publish saying "no garentees" or publish saying this has been vetted? 
- Is it worth trying to maintain something like that? 
- Is the usage board a good place to discuss or maintain mappings like these? 

Grace arrives; introductions.

__Tom__: 
- I'd like to know by the end of this call:
    - how everyone would like to proceed with this
    - is this something that we can handle as a group, if so how would we go about doing that?
        - github issues and one or two teleconferences 
    - do we want to focus only on close matches or are broad and narrow matches relevant?
    - do we want to look at the type vocab/ other classes?
    - do we want to publish the mappings on the dcmi website in rdf or as webpages
    - do we want to include equivalence in dcmi metadata terms the way that we include foaf maker as an al equivalent property under DC terms creator 
    - on wikidata there are some different options: 
        - go to individual property pages and add an equivalent property to dcmi metadata terms and then those can be extracted via a sparql query
        - another option would be to make a static table--would look more like an official position of dcmi in terms of what maps to what (functionally they would say the same thing)

__Antoine__: 
- suggestion to publish mappings somewhere for schema.org because a lot of schema.org properties come directly from dcmi properties 
- earlier task group tried to do this 
- less convinced with wikidata, too unstable, definitions change quickly and the scale of this work is quite daunting
- schema more stable and farther along
- suggestion to resume schema.org work to get an idea of the fesability 
- exact match vs close vs broad: 
    - helpful to keep track of close and broad match
    - way to keep track of decisions as to why there wouldn't be an exact match 
- task group mappings from before--suggests that Grace look at these to see what differences there are
    - these differences can tell us about the evolution of schema.org 

__Stefanie__: 
- Were the task group mappings from schema to dc? and not the other way around? 

__Antoine__: 
- direction of mappings depended on the properties available 
    -if the schema.org properties were more specialized than the dublin core ones then the mapping would be from schema to dc but it could well have worked the other way around
    
__Stefanie__: 
- doesn't work one to one 
- arguing direciton matters, so wouldn't be able to base new mappings off of the old ones 

__Stuart__:
- what is the relevence of the direction of the mappings?
- it seems to me that it would be functionally the same mapping predicate 

__Stefanie__: 
- if you're mapping dc "creator" to schema.org "creator" it's the same both ways but if you're mapping schema.org "editor" it doesn't work that way 

__Stuart__:
- worries about matientnace 
- would be a challange to keep mappings up to date because schema and wiki are ever changing 
- these mappings will take a significant effort-is this worth it?
- mappings are definetly valuable 
- the US department of congress is sponsoring the mapping of seven terms in the education to work force domain 

__Karen__:
- important to do (even if its small) a Dcmi-schema mappings because there are many people who use schema that have dubin core in their data 
  - keep it simple, 1-1 mappings
- these main properties and classes are relatively stable in schema 

__Tom__: Should schema be the focus? Wikidata? Bibframe?

__Stefanie__: 
- sees use for mapping to schema 
- sees no use for wikidata mappings because much different 
- dcmi uses bibleographic data while wikidata is full text with some kind of metadata around it 
 

__Phil__:
- we need to be driven by use cases and close matches to dc to schema seem to have the most use cases  

__Stefanie__: 
- agree, driven by use cases should be a thing
- should focus on close matches to schema 
- start small and if we find out that there are people who want more

__Karen__: 
- should not only do close matches, but they should be 1:1 
- could see some value in including broader terms from schema to Dc

__Stefanie__: 
- should do dc to schema, schema to dc already exists in the task group mappings 

__Karen__: 
- that would probably have to be redone becasue schema has changed
-I think we should start with 1:1 dc to schema getting actual use cases  

__Antoine__: 
- agrees
- I think we shouldnt determine a property right now (exact match), could be that we find some fairly useful equivalents that could be used for a bidirectional mapping
- not pushing to get exact equivalents now but it would be a pity to spot them and not keep track of them 


__Phil__:
- agree that we should keep track of them but we should be more cirumspect about what we publish 
- reason I said close match before is because we want to be able to take data in DC and translate it to schema and know that will still make sense 
    - this doesn't necesarily have to be a one to one match 
__Stefanie__: 
- There is never really a best match you can make 

__Stuart__: 
- yes they're all approximate 
- test of whether the extensitons would fit makes sense in use cases where people want to do model interchange (want to take their data that is in schema and turn it into dc or vice versa) 
- utility of the extenstion is whether that type of interchange is possible 

__Joe__: 
- fine with this, think we should try to be helpful as possible 
- path towards that doesn't matter to me 
- we're always going to be revising, just a matter of how often we want to do this 

__Karen__: 
-suggests that we to a small one-one 
-we should do it on hack.md, which would allow us to comment (highlight and then can make a comment)
- leave what's there but go through and select the one that we think is "the one"
-could also do this for the classes

__Tom__: are the classes a priority?

__Karen__: 
- suggest that we do a small one to one
- suggest that we do it on hackMD because it allows comments 
- suggest that Grace and I, before our meeting tomororw go through and select the mapping that we think is "the one" 
- i guess we'd have to do that with the classes too

__Tom__: 
- are the classes a priority for everyone? 

__Karen__: 
- I think they can be second, it is easier to get an understanding of it by going through the properties 

__Tom__:
- there are not that many mappings to classes 

__Karen__: 
- would that be useful for people? to be able to look at a one to one tomorrow 

__Stefanie__:
- that would be a good idea but we should start with the 15 elements tomorrow and see how far we get 

__Karen__: 
- we dont have the 15 but we could highlight those and do those first

__Tom__: 
- go through hack md doc, take out non schema 
- highlight parts that work 
- other call tomorrow to go through hackmd 

__Stuart__: 
- need to consider old mappings 

__Tom__: 
- I will dig out the old mappings 

__Karen__: 
- these go from schema to dc so we will first go through the dc to schema and then go back and look for anything glaringly off 

__Tom__:
- who is interested in continuing for an hour tomororw to discuss the schema.org properties?
any support for bibframe or wiki?

__Stefanie__: 
- let's do schema.org first and then address bibframe
- I dont see any use for wikidata but there maybe are people who would want this
