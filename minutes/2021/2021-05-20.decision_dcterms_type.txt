APPROVED

To drop the range of rdfs:Class for dcterms:type.

Rationales:

- With the range of rdfs:Class, things never thought of as classes are inferred to be classes.
- The property is already widely used with SKOS concepts as object.

Approved by: Tom, Karen, Antoine, Osma, Phil, Stuart, Kai, Dan, Stefanie, Joachim.

Approval is unanimous among UB members who voted, with no nay votes or abstentions.
