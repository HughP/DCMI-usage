## DCMI Usage Board 

The Usage Board serves as DCMI's decision-making body on technical specifications to which DCMI, as an organization, makes a long-term maintenance commitment. This commitment is a statement to the general public of an intent to maintain a core set of high-priority assets as living specifications, subject to periodic review on the basis of published principles.

This maintenace commitment builds on and extends the DCMI Persistence Policy [1], by which the organization pledges to keep its documents available on the Web, with change histories, for as long as it is able, and to offer them to future hosts in the event that DCMI is disbanded.

The commitment applies first and foremost to DCMI Metadata Terms [2]: to its machine- and human-readable manifestions, to international standards based on the Terms, to mappings to related vocabularies, and to the Namespace Policy [3] that specifies the policies and principles governing changes or extensions to DCMI-branded vocabularies generally.

Agreements with other vocabulary maintainers, such as the Agreement between DCMI and the FOAF Project [4], also fall under the remit of the Usage Board.

Resources permitting, the Usage Board may extend its scope to other technical specifications subject to the procedures set out in the Usage Board's Process Manual, the relevant sections of the DCMI Bylaws (as revised from time-to-time), and the oversight of the Governing Board.
