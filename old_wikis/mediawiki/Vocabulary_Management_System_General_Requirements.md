## Introduction 

The following suggested core requirements were used as the basis of discussion on [Vocabulary Management System Functional Requirements](/mediawiki_wiki/Vocabulary_Management_System_Functional_Requirements.md) during the [DCMI Registry Community](http://www.dublincore.org/groups/registry/) session at DC-2011.

## Core Requirements for a DCMI Vocabulary Management System 

1. Open source application;
2. Application development supported by a viable, recognized open source development community;
3. Easy to implement, configure and maintain;
4. At a minimum, provides support for all current DCMI vocabulary management needs and functions;
5. Provides support for 1-_n_ community-based ontologies including access control and workflow management for creation, publication, versioning (including historical record), management & preservation;
6. Supports full import/export functionality (all flavors of [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/)) and includes migration support (or presents no impediments to future migration);
7. Serves as a DCMI "best-practice exemplar" by being deployable by anyone wishing to maintain a vocabulary;
8. Capable of being branded in furtherance of DCMI's vocabulary management, alignment and preservation agenda.
