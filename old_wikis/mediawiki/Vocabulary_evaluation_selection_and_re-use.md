## Vocabulary Evaluation, Selection and Re-use

### Introduction to the Outline

The draft outline show below is based on the issues and questions developed during the [DC-2011 Vocabulary Management and Alignment Special Session](/mediawiki_wiki/Where_We_Started.md). The [report of that session](/mediawiki_wiki/DC-2011_Vocabulary_Special_Session/Meeting_Report.md) provided a wealth of issues on the minds of the best thinkers about vocabulary management that could be gathered in one place. Asking the questions of each other and pointing out the plethora of possible answers is central to the task of gathering what extant guidance we can find, evaluating that, ordering the issues in a useful way, and as a Community, filling in what we can offer about available options.

This wiki is open to volunteers who'd like to get involved in building this resource. Please contact [Diane Hillmann](mailto:metadata.maven@gmail.com) to be provided with an account [Note: if you already have an account for another DCMI wiki, try that first].

### Recommended Documentation for Vocabularies as a Whole

- Documentation about vocabularies is vitally important, particularly for potential users in the stage of evaluation, but also for the community already using the vocabulary. Documentation should include the following:
  - Explanation of the vocabulary structure as well as a full description of vocabulary itself
  - Whether or not there are multilingual aspects or if planned
  - The disciplinary perspective perspective that informs the point of view and definitions of the vocabulary
  - Whether the vocabulary is usually or may be adopted within a multiple vocabulary adoption (layered)
  - Whether the vocabulary is aimed at a specialized or a general audience
    - In the case of an area of vocabulary interest where usage is shifting and the context is especially volatile vocabs, a management and maintenance strategy is critical in determining fitness for re-use 
    - For example, vocabularies covering time-based issues, like oil importing countries where membership changes over time (temporal drift)
    - We should look at archival practices for more insight into possible best practices for general vocabularies
  - Use cases are needed to help provide a context for best practices in this area

- Policy and Governance issues
  - Formal organization (e.g., AGROVOC has a governance charter)
    - Organizational expertise, roles and responsibilities
    - Community involvement
    - Maintenance policy
      - Persistence policy for deleted or deprecated properties or concepts
    - Editorial policy
    - Extension policy (Openness for expansion or linkage by others)
    - Versioning plan
  - Sustainability plan, with exit and preservation strategies 
  - Rights issues and policies for all stakeholders
    - License requirements and expectations
    - Expectations around IP rights for language versions, whether done by owner or others

### Measuring and Assessing Quality Control and Usefulness

- How much quality control is necessary? What are the criteria for assessment?
  - Are there conflicting statements, concepts or definitions? 
  - Does the source vocabulary contain constraints on properties, concepts, domains, etc. Are these well expressed and articulated within the vocabulary or in the URI?
  - Does the vocabulary contain conflicts due to lack of quality control? (for example, typos, un-moored relationships, label preferences?)
  - Because trust is not a yes/no aspect, is there documentation describing the context and point of view of the vocabulary creator?
  - Does the focus of the vocabulary creator fit the needs of the potential re-use? Is the coverage sufficient for the intended re-use? 

- How do we work with imperfect choices and determine usefulness?
- In a Linked Data world, do we have different requirements or assumptions that need to be accommodated?
  - Is the distribution of the vocabulary within the domain important? 
  - Do we need to allow for redundancy where coverage is spotty?
  - How do we evaluate the growth patterns of the vocabulary, and is it an important consideration (Should it develop “like emergence of natural language” [B. Vatant]?)
    - Vocabularies are similar to natural languages, and require time and curation, particularly where top down and bottom up approaches meet (for instance, in relating controlled vocabularies with social tagging or folksonomies).

### Discovery Issues

- Discovery of property vocabularies is a different problem than discovery of concept vocabularies.
  - There are no good tools for discovering what’s available. Swoogle is not working for that purpose.

### Selection Issues

- Selection criteria in a Linked Data context generally have a goal of finding the right properties for dataset
  - Is the vocabulary available on the web?
  - Is the vocabulary open or proprietary?
  - What is the level of complexity/richness available within the vocabulary?
  - Is the vocabulary properly maintained and up-to-date? 
  - Are the services provided adequate (and how do we define adequate)?
  - Is the vocabulary author or owner trustworthy (and how do we assess that)?
  - Is there evidence of extensive use of this vocabulary? (Mondeca has findings)
  - Are the labels used familiar to the intended audience?

### Re-Use Issues

- In a Linked Open Data world can we be less conservative about choices?
