## Domains and Ranges: Barcelona discussion - FROZEN COPY FOR REFERENCE EDIT DomainsActionsDone INSTEAD

- Note: In the following section, wherever we say "resource" we mean non-literal resource. See section on Problematic Properties.

- Note: In Barcelona, the terms were taken out of order, starting with "audience". In these revised notes, the terms have been put back into their usual order.

== Problematic properties ==

 ISSUE: A title with multiple encodings is different from multiple title statements. 

ISSUE: When domain is stated to be rdfs:resource in /terms/ part of the Domains proposal we intend it to mean non-literal resource because the meaning of rdfs:Resource is broader and includes literals.

ISSUE: Where the domain and range is resource, we can either say nothing, or we can say rdfs:Resource (which is stating the obvious) -- this is related to our actions related to specifically stating non-literal resource.

ISSUE: Because we have inverses in the isFormatOf type properties, we need the same class at both ends of the inverse -- therefore we should make all non-literal resources (TBA).

AGREED: We are going to propose that range of description, abstract, and table of contents is rdfs:resource knowing that this causes OWL-DL incompatability for these properties - this will go out for comment - we're asking if this is reasonable to do this for these three properties.

AGREED: We need a class and will define a class of non-literal resources for both domains and ranges.

ACTION 2007-03-18: Andy to add a new class of non-literal resource to the wiki, use as domain and range as appropriate.

AGREED: Usage of this [non-literal] class for domains should be part of the next comment period.

ISSUE: Whether owl:Thing is a suitable thing for defining a class of non-literal resources. Formal semantics seem worryingly opaque in the OWL spec.

- ACTION: Tom to transcribe easel graph into the meeting notes (Tom and Andy have pictures)

- ACTION 2007-03-18: (for lack of volunteers, by default Tom): write a proposal capturing the issue of string, unspecified, and thing for the problematic DCTERMS properties (title and its subproperties, date and its subproperties, and description and its subproperties). Taking the following position:

  - 1. Title and its subproperties as literals [check notes]

  - 2. Date and its subproperties as literals

  - 3. Description and its subproperties as range = rdfs:resource

- Then send this proposal out for public comment. There are two audiences for this comment: (1) multiple script communities and (2) SW community asking: best practice for unspecified ranges. Note that we will use the non-literal resource in all cases where the domain of our properities is listed as rdfs:resource (in the proposal).
