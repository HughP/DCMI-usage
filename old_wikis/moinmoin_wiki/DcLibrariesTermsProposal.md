## Request for Creating three terms in the DCMI namespace

Robina Clayphan, July 2008

In May 2002 the Usage Board ruled on three requests from the DC Libraries Working Group for terms to be created in the DCMI namespace. They were envisaged as having particular value for the DC Libraries Application Profile and were also generally useful for other communities.

The Usage Board decided that the terms could all be found in the MODS namespace and should be re-used from there. These decisions were in line with the principles of interoperability and the re-use of metadata terms in the development of DC application profiles (DCAPs) at that time. Since 2002, however, the understanding of data models has matured considerably. The way relationships between resources and their properties are structured has raised significant questions about the feasibility of simply mixing and matching elements based on little more than semantic equivalence.

The difficulty with re-using the MODS terms in the recommended way did not become fully apparent until a draft XML schema for DC-Lib was produced in 2005. ( [http://epub.mimas.ac.uk/DC/dc-lib/xsd/dclib.xsd](http://epub.mimas.ac.uk/DC/dc-lib/xsd/dclib.xsd)). My report on why re-use was problematic is contained in the document entitled "MODS Terms In DC-Lib Proposal" which can be found in the file area of the DC Libries list at [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/filearea.cgi?LMGT1=DC-IBRARIES&X=1FB172010721063BAD&Y=robinaclayphan%40googlemail.com](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/filearea.cgi?LMGT1=DC-IBRARIES&X=1FB172010721063BAD&Y=robinaclayphan%40googlemail.com)

After some discussion it was informally agreed in September 2006 that the UB would allow the creation of the three terms in the DCMI namespace even though policy had now moved on with regard to where terms should be declared. There is an outstanding action on me to submit the original term proposals to the UB in order for them to move this forward. This paper represents a request for the UB to now approve and adopt these terms into the DCMI namespace.

- Term: Captured

- Term: Version

- \* The term "version" was proposed as a refinement of the DC element "description". The text of the proposal can be seen at [http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/description-version\_prop.html](http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/description-version_prop.html)

- Term: Location

- \* The term "holdingLocation" was proposed as a new DC element. The text of the proposal can be seen at [http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/holding-location\_prop.html](http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/05/holding-location_prop.html)
