- **Title: Dublin Core Usage Board Review of Collections Application Profile**

**- Date: 2007-07-02** 
- **Description: The document is the result of a March 2007 review by the DCMI Usage Board of the "Dublin Core Collections Application Profile".**

#### About the profile

The Collections Application Profile [1] was developed in order to provide a method for describing "collections" -- both collections of resources and catalogues of collections of resources (in essence a specialised form of "collection") -- that conforms to the DCMI Abstract Model [2]. The Collections Application Profile defines collection as "any aggregation of physical and/or digital resources". Examples of collections include aggregations of natural (i.e. physical) objects, created objects, "born-digital" items, and digital surrogates of physical items. The Collections Application Profile is not intended to describe every possible characteristic of resource collections, as its primary purpose is discovery.

The simple descriptions provided for in the Collections Application Profile are suitable for describing many different types of collections. Descriptions using this Application Profile are primarily designed to support:

- discovery of collections;

- identification of collections;

- selection of collections;

- identification of collection locations;

- identification of services providing access to collections.

The domain model used in the Collections Application Profile is based on "An analytical model of collections and their catalogues" by Michael Heaney [9]. This model focuses on Collections. Collections hold Items, are described by Catalogues or Indexes, are located in Locations and accessed via Services, and are owned or collected by Owners who provide Services.

Descriptions of Collections specify the nature of a collection, its name, size, language, topic, intended audience, and scope, as well as the methods and policies by which items are added to the collection. In addition, the profile indicates the Collector and Owner of the collection, points to the location where the collection is held and services which provide access, and notes any related collections, catalogues, or publications.

In order to do this, the Collections Application Profile uses DCMI terms along with more specialized terms created for use in the profile [3]. Controlled vocabularies of values were created for use in this profile: the Dublin Core Collection Description Type Vocabulary [4], an Accrual Method Vocabulary [5], an Accrual Policy Vocabulary [6], and a Frequency Vocabulary [7]. A summary of terms and constraints used in the profile was compiled into a tabular list [8].

Building on prior work of the UKOLN Collection Description Focus [11] on the Resource Support Libraries Programme [12] (see also [13]), the DCMI Collection Description Working Group began in 2002 [10]. The initial development of the Collections Application Profile was led by Pete Johnston, chair of the Collections Description Working Group [15]. This working group was characterised by an interested and involved community who provided lengthy and valuable comments on various drafts of the Application Profile, showing a high-level of buy-in to the Application Profile by the community.

The DCMI Usage Board undertook an informal review of the draft profile in September 2005. The Application Profile was then formally submitted to the Usage Board for a review in mid-2006, resulting in further feedback to the Working Group. When Pete stood down as chair of the Group in 2006, work on the Application profile was taken over by Sarah Shreeves and Muriel Foulonneau. Sarah and Muriel submitted a revised version of the Collections Application Profile to the Usage Board in March 2007 and the Profile was reviewed by the Usage Board at its March 2007 meeting. Although some minor issues (detailed below) were flagged, the Application Profile was approved as a conforming Application Profile by the Usage Board.

### Review criteria and result

The Usage Board determined that the Collections Application Profile "conforms", which in this context was taken to mean:

- the profile's usage of terms conforms to the DCMI Abstract Model;

- profile, taken as a whole, is internally consistent; and

- the profile is sufficiently documented to serve the needs of the community of interest.

### Other comments

Some minor issues were identified by the Usage Board but these did not present a barrier to assigning conforming status to the Profile. The issues identified during the final review of the Profile were:

- Lack of clarity about whether items can belong to more than one collection

- Usage of ‘record’ undefined – perhaps from DCAM glossary?

- Lack of distinction between physical and digital items

- Confusion over difference between unitary finding aids and catalogs/indices

- Overlap of ideas between collection location and collection identity
