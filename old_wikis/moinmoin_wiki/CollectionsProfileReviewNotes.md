## Barcelona discussion of Collections Profile

See: [http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/Topic-cdap.txt](http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/Topic-cdap.txt)

See: [http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/ProfileReviewCriteria.pdf](http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2007/03/barcelona/ProfileReviewCriteria.pdf)

- AGREED: The following are the three categories used to evaluate application profiles that come before the UB:

  - 1. Conforms to the DCMI Abstract Model (done - see Manzanillo notes)

  - 2. Internal consistency

  - 3. Documented according to our guidelines for application profiles

- Issue 1: data model, its role in the AP. They have removed references to the AMCC that require dependency, still a relationship.

  - p. 154 contains a reference, describes the relationships with the model, Joe suggests clarification needed. on p. 10 of the ap document, a UML-like diagram, describes their now free-standing data model. A bit later there's a separate model of the layers. Joe points out that there is no distinction between physical or digital resources, both can have locations. Raju asks whether items (his example was serials) can be spread across multiple collections, answer is ambiguous.

- Issue 2. Document and scope, p. 88 of the packet. New section, purpose and scope has been added.

- Issue 3. Confusion between collections and "collections of collections". Went back to one profile from two separate ones, and confusing bits have been clarified.

- Issue 4. Change of Label for "Collection-Description". Aspect of confusion problem above. Have attempted to identify terms better in their property list.

- Issue 5. Conflation of unitary finding aids and catalogs/indices Confusing use with the AP, generally stems from AMCC model. Defined, but not in the pictures, suggests it's a leftover from the AMCC model dependency. Andy thinks this isn't necessarily a problem. Other related issues are whether they're using "record" and not indicating where it is defined, may be DCAM.

- Issue 6: The term "content" is used in the definition of item. Issues raised about location and the lack of distinction between physical and digital items arise again--is location useful for digital, UB thinks probably not (p. 90 of packet)

- Issues we did not bring up but they did:

  - Renamed AP

  - Other minor modifications

- AGREED: It conforms.

- ACTION 2007-03-17: To draft a review that contains: (Andrew)

  - 1. Descriptive piece which demonstrates that we have read the profile and understood it

  - 2. Present the result ("it conforms")

  - 3. Then present considerations, e.g., acknowledge that DCMI's DCAP guidelines are currently still a moving target and that they have met the guidelines "such as they are" or words to that effect.
