- Replaces=ok

- [IsRequiredBy](http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/IsRequiredBy)=no (change to make parallel with Requires) "A related resource that requires the described resource to support its function, delivery, or coherence"

- Requires= change to "A related resource that is required by the described resource to support its function, delivery, or coherence" - drop 'content'

- [IsPartOf](http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/IsPartOf)=change to "A related resource in which the described resource is physically or logically included."

  - JUSTIFICATION: parallel construction

- accessRights:

  - AGREED: change comment to: "Access Rights may include information regarding access or restrictions based on privacy, security or other policies."

  - this substitutes policies for regulations

- bibliographicCitation: AGREED: approved

- rightsHolder: AGREED: remove comment

- provenance: AGREED: approved

- instructionalMethod: AGREED: approved

  - ISSUE: we recognize a set of concepts for language, however, interpreting the ISO639-2 as a set of concepts would break the namespace policy because ISO639-2 is a set of strings (defined by ISO and us).

  - ACTION 2007-03-17: Joe will draft a document discussing issues related to principles and purpose of UB decision-making (context: decision to define ISO639-2 as a set of codes - see [http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DCTermsChangesActions](http://dublincore.org/usageboardwiki/DCTermsChangesActions)).

- ACTION 2007-03-17: Tom change all encoding schemes to follow the LCSH change in definition

- ACTION 2007-03-17: Tom to find "uses a controlled vocabulary", report to list, and remove from comments.

- NOTE: if interoperability is operationalized as keeping current encoding schemes already in our namespace, then we should add new terms to keep it up to date.

- QUESTION: Do we need "qualifies statements"? [e.g., p. 57]

  - AGREED: remove "qualifies" statements and discuss encoding schemes in application profiles only, not in dcterms

  - JUSTIFICATION: this kind of information belongs in an application profile

  - AGREED: yes for contributor and relation; no for subject [p. 41]

  - JUSTIFICATION: for contributor and relation = clarifies semantics
